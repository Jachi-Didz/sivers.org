TO-DO for sivers.org:

Reduce size of CSS
	This might mean getting rid of Foundation, since I'm not using most of its features.
	Here's what I'm using from Foundation:
		grid for float-left images
		same images nicely auto-resizing at smaller screen size
		responsive un-floating of same
		panels on home page
		form input highlighting and shadow
		padded colored buttons

/code
	Move from 50pop.com/code
