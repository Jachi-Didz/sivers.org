Supply and demand: <strong>the more people do something, the less valuable it is</strong>.
</p><p>
Everyone else is multi-tasking.  Learn to <a href="http://sivers.org/book/PowerOfLess">single-task</a>.
</p><p>
Everyone else is hyper-connected.  Learn to turn off your computer.

Warren Buffett says one simple rule dictates his stock buying: “<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/17/opinion/17buffett.html">Be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful.</a>”
</p><p>
One way to be outstanding and valuable is to do what others aren't doing, or what most can't.

In the U.S., the <a href="http://www.payscale.com/research/US/Industry=Translation_Services/Salary">average translator salary</a> for Spanish is $24,500, and for Arabic is $41,700.

If you play an instrument, give it a twist that nobody's done before. Like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6SHsF1n9Qw">Greg Pattillo's beatbox flute</a>, with over <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/freedomworksfilms">20 million YouTube views</a>, who the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/22/nyregion/22ink.html">New York Times called “the only person in the world who does what he does”</a>.

When I made a living playing colleges, I had three different acts: a rock band, a solo acoustic act, and <a href="http://professionalpests.com/">The Professional Pests</a>, where I'd run around in a black lycra bag, bothering people.  The Professional Pests out-booked the other acts by 5-to-1, because there are tons of rock bands, tons of solo acoustic acts, but only one place to hire a guy running around in a black lycra bag.

Look around at what your competitors are doing.  Can you do something radically opposite?  If they're trying to be all-inclusive, can you be exclusive?
</p><p>
Doing the opposite of everyone is valuable.

<em>I would quote the famous poem (“<a href="http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15717">Two roads diverged in a wood, and I took the one less traveled by</a>”), but <a href="http://poetry.suite101.com/article.cfm/robert_frost_s_tricky_poem">closer analysis of it</a> says it was really mildly teasing his indecisive friend.</em>
