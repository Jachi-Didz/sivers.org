The most powerful philosophy of marketing I’ve heard is from my hero <a href="http://sethgodin.com/">Seth Godin</a>, and I think it can be summed up as this:
</p><p>
<strong>You’ll know when you’re on to something special, because people will love it so much they’ll tell everyone.</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>If people aren’t telling their friends about it yet, don’t waste time marketing it.  Instead, keep improving until they are.</strong>
</p><p>
How can you apply this to your business, music, product, or service?
</p><p>
<a href="http://changethis.com/50.01.Tribes">Seth wrote</a>: “<strong>Sell one</strong>. Find one person who trusts you and sell him a copy. Does he love it? Is he <strong>excited enough to tell ten friends because it helps them, not because it helps you? If not, you must stop what you’re doing and start over.</strong>”
</p><p>
This is encouraging, because in the past it felt like the only way to do effective marketing was to spend a ton of money on mass-media advertising.
</p><p>
But now the goal is to <strong>create something absolutely remarkable, until customer word-of-mouth generates a buzz</strong>.
</p><p>
And that’s only limited by your creativity and persistence, not budget.
