&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This essay is by Jeremy Wellard, who is based in Hanoi at &lt;a href="http://c3vietnam.com/"&gt;C3 Vietnam&lt;/a&gt;, and is founding director of &lt;a href="http://communehanoi.com/"&gt;Commune Hanoi&lt;/a&gt;, a co-working cafe and creative hub.  This is the first chapter of my new &lt;a href="http://woodegg.com/vn"&gt;Vietnam 2014 book&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only thing most people know of Vietnam is the Vietnam War.  In Vietnam, they call it the American War, and it’s just old history.  There is so much more to this youthful, thriving country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vietnam has long been considered the cultural and artistic heart of Asia, and the Vietnamese are the “Italians of Asia”. Highly social and heart-driven, with a penchant for drama and performance they are quick to raise their voices to sway a discussion, but equally quick to laugh off a misunderstanding. One of the greatest strengths of Vietnamese is their ability to find joy in everyday moments. Whether laboring in the fields or rushing through busy urban lives, they still find any excuse to put down their tools and laugh in conversation over a cup of tea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since opening up to the world in the late 1980s, the Vietnamese have been racing ahead at full speed. Years of struggle under a system of collective production left people ready to enthusiastically embrace capitalist ideals. Since the late 1990s, Vietnam has had one of the highest economic growth rates in the world. This rapid growth created a highly entrepreneurial environment where everyone seems to have a second or third business on the side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vietnam is the world’s only “Socialist-Oriented Market Economy”. This means the government maintains a large ownership and control of major companies, while small and medium businesses are left to develop freely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forget any notions of the frugal communist lifestyle. Wealth and possessions are flaunted as signs of success. People will spend many months’ salary for a status symbol like an iPhone, fancy motorbike, or designer clothes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet there’s a deep-seated habit of saving money wherever possible. This can be seen in shops, where the air-conditioning is turned off until a customer walks in, or in the recycling culture where even used plastic bags have value. Vietnamese take great pride in their bargaining skills. When a new purchase is shown to friends, someone will immediately ask how much they paid for it. Ability to negotiate a good price demonstrates not just savvy but strong relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trading on relationships is key.  A popular saying is, “First your family, second your friends, third comes money.”  This means people will always look out for family and friends, but for outsiders their help comes at a price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strong family networks define the career and social lives of many Vietnamese. The government strongly recommends families have only two children, and most do. There are highly traditional expectations regarding responsibility to family, education, career choices, gender roles, marriage, and children. Newly wed couples live at the home of the husband’s parents until they can afford to buy their own house. Three generations often live together under one roof, and grandparents play an important role in providing childcare. Because of this in-home care, mothers usually return to work much sooner than the six months of maternity leave given by Vietnam’s labor laws, which strongly favor worker’s rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Vietnam, the year and date of a person’s birth is very important. It influences their whole life, including when they are allowed to marry, open a business, hold important meetings and have children. Social interactions and forms of address are determined by age, so upon meeting a new person, one of the first questions Vietnamese will ask is what year they were born.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of a strongly collective past, where standing out from the crowd was potentially dangerous, new ideas may be regarded with caution.  But once the viability of an idea is demonstrated, acceptance, imitation and adaptation rapidly follow.  This tendency to follow others can lead Vietnamese to seem unoriginal in their thinking. But in fact their ability to quickly see an opportunity and willingness to capitalize on it creates a very dynamic and exciting environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the collective past, upwardly mobile Vietnamese have fully embraced the concept that the individual who works smarter and has more relationships can have more than their neighbor. A new “me-first” culture is rising. But there still remains a highly structured society underneath. In many ways, Vietnam is perhaps both the most-collective and least-collective of the Asian cultures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vietnamese have been living with occupation, change and uncertainty for thousands of years and have developed community-based social systems that preserve order and personal freedom at a micro level, regardless of macro changes. As the local saying goes, “The rules of the village are stronger than the rules of the king.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike common misconceptions regarding Communist states, Vietnam is actually a democracy, and all citizens have the right to vote every three years. Although they can only choose candidates from one political party, within this party there are factions with very different viewpoints. Individuals have a lot of freedom in most areas of everyday life. Overall though, they tend to avoid openly discussing political issues. Speaking against the government, protesting high-level corruption, or promoting other political systems can incur severe punishments for locals and expulsion for foreigners.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vietnam is chaotic, but far from lawless. The country has an advanced legal system. But there are many ways in which rules can seem more like guidelines. A “no” can become a “yes” with the right timing and persuasion. This can seem daunting, but those who understand the system are great at navigating its complexities. This is one of the main reasons foreign business people need a trusted local partner or good lawyer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foreigners are surprised that sociopolitical tensions are actually highest with China, rather than the United States, France, or Japan.  Vietnam is increasingly wary of China’s growing power and territorial ambitions.  This has caused a strong wave of anti-China sentiment where Chinese products, particularly food, are considered poor quality and unhealthy. It has also driven a celebration of products “Made in Vietnam” and is combining with a growing awareness of health and safety to birth a clean-food movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only thing constant in Vietnam is change. Trends come and go, businesses open and close, and construction is a constant. The pervasive dust and noise are the sweat and tears of progress. But underneath this turmoil, there is a country that remains deeply Vietnamese, and people who are proud, ambitious, and happy to be open to a world of opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Understanding Singapore</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the first chapter of my new &lt;a href="http://woodegg.com/sg"&gt;Singapore 2014 book&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I tell people I live in Singapore, the most common misunderstandings I hear are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“How can you live in that sterile squeaky-clean police state?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Isn’t that where they cane people for chewing gum?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Disneyland with a death penalty! Haha!”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“What part of China is that in?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not surprised when people misunderstand Singapore, because it requires a little explanation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;First - some important context:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Singapore is an island so small you can drive around the whole country in two hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1819, it was set up by the British as a tax-free trading port, instantly attracting business from the entire region.  So it’s always had a mix of Malay, Indian, and Chinese people, though the majority are Chinese.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It quickly became an anything-goes town, with opium, prostitution and gambling, run by secret societies.  Its nickname was “Sin-Galore”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1963, Singapore became a part of Malaysia.  But racial tensions between the Malay and Chinese populations led to ongoing race riots.  So in 1965, Singapore was kicked out of Malaysia, making it suddenly (and reluctantly) an independent country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Singapore had no natural resources, no local industry, and was geographically vulnerable, few people believed it would survive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But being a do-or-die survival situation, the government and people of Singapore got extremely focused, pragmatic, and competitive to do whatever it takes to make this tiny island thrive against the odds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their main survival strategy was to focus on making Singapore an ideal place for big business — attracting multinational corporations to set up their Asian headquarters here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these historical ingredients are important for the rest of this explanation to make sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Why so clean?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because Singapore is so small, keeping it clean is a manageable job.  (You can’t easily clean India or China.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But really the cleanliness is marketing.  What better way to prove to multinational corporations that Singapore is a stable, trustable, and efficient place to set up your headquarters?  It’s no coincidence that the highway leading from the airport to downtown has the most perfectly manicured landscape.  First impressions matter to visiting CEOs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s why the country’s leaders all wear white.  It’s a show of incorruptibility — a metaphor for being orderly and transparent with attention to detail.  Getting to know Singapore’s government is like looking under the hood of a Ferrari.  It’s incredibly well-designed and well-run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Singapore is always selling itself to the world.  The chairman of the government’s Economic Development Board told his colleagues, “We are in the hospitality business.”  The government works hard to stay competitive on every international measure.  Any time there are international rankings comparing countries, you’ll find Singapore near the top of the list.  Except for free speech, but I’ll cover that next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly: why no chewing gum?  Purely pragmatic.  It was gumming up the subway system, causing delays, and was too hard to clean off surfaces, so the sale of it was banned.  Keeping the country clean and running smoothly was more important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that’s why Singapore has an international reputation for being so clean.  It’s brilliant marketing — visual proof of the order and cleanliness you can expect if you set up your business or banking here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Why so strict?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three reasons: transformation, size, and marketing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First: transformation.  To quickly turn Singapore from “Sin-Galore” to being the Switzerland of Asia would require great strategy and strict, uncompromising execution of that strategy.  We’re used to seeing this in corporations, like Jack Welch at GE or Steve Jobs returning to Apple, but it’s surprising to see it carried out successfully in a government.  (Many say Singapore is more like a corporation than a country.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it worked!  In one generation, Singapore went through the most dramatic increase in the standard of living that the world has ever seen.  In one generation, this tiny dot went from being broke to being one of the richest countries in the world, without any natural resources, purely by strict execution of a great strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its lack of corruption was an important ingredient in its success.  In a region where political corruption is rampant, Singapore is the only country that severely punishes corruption.  It regularly ranks in the top 5 least corrupt countries in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next: size.  Singapore’s UN representative once said, “America is like an aircraft carrier.  If you jump up and down, it’s not going to shake.  Singapore is like a canoe.  If you jump up and down, it will sink.  If you lose stability in Singapore, you lose everything.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly: marketing.  When an American teenager vandalized 18 cars in Singapore, he was sentenced to jail and caning.  This turned into an international incident, with Bill Clinton asking Singapore not to prosecute him.  But as a government official said, “It was a way of demonstrating that Singapore was prepared to stand up against the mighty America.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me, that’s brilliant marketing.  A memorable way for a country to prove to the world that they obey the rule of law, without exception, and don’t waive the laws for special requests from powerful people.  I think this kind of approach makes corporate leaders more likely to do their business and banking in Singapore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All that said, you could argue that Singapore is not so strict — less strict than Switzerland or California — because it’s a &lt;em&gt;laissez-faire&lt;/em&gt; “do what you want” approach where life and business are not regulated for most of us in the middle.  Only the behavior that clearly hurts others or society is punished.  Everyone else gets to live in an incredibly safe, crime-and-corruption-free place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;So very pragmatic&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The common thread behind everything here is pragmatism.  The country’s leadership consistently makes rational choices to improve the strength and profitability of Singapore.  It’s pragmatic, not dogmatic.  It’s not that the leaders of Singapore hate chewing gum or are neat freaks.  These were just rational decisions to do what was best for the country at that time.  The prime minister has a degree in Computer Science, as does the deputy prime minister.  This is a country run by engineers and economists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it’s important to know that these things are changing fast.  The government is constantly but conservatively re-assessing its stance on everything, to keep up with the times.  The last few years have seen a huge move towards more democracy and free speech, with the theater and arts scene blossoming because of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Singapore’s #1 enemy is complacency.  Now that Singapore is one of the most successful countries in the world, the top priority is to keep that competitive edge.  This “keep on your toes” message is constantly communicated at all levels — a reminder to never assume that things will stay this good.  Keep pushing.  Stay on top.  Don’t let your guard down.  Always be competitive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Singapore was founded on the ideals of the Age of Enlightenment — the age of reason and rationality — and its founder built those lofty ideals into its blueprint.  So to understand Singapore, you need to understand that it’s always been designed top-down, from the beginning, to realize these rational ideals.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This essay is by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/danielziv"&gt;Daniel Ziv&lt;/a&gt;, who has worked in Indonesia for 14 years as a journalist, editor, and now filmmaker. He wrote the bestselling book “&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/9799589878"&gt;Jakarta Inside Out&lt;/a&gt;” and directed the award-winning new documentary film &lt;a href="http://jalananmovie.com/"&gt;JALANAN&lt;/a&gt;, about the lives of three Jakarta street musicians.  This is the first chapter of my new &lt;a href="http://woodegg.com/id"&gt;Indonesia 2014 book&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indonesia is the world’s 4th biggest country by population, but is still a work in progress - a beta version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indonesia 1.0 began in 1945, when they gained independence from the Dutch and became a country.  Suddenly, 17,000 islands, 300 ethnic groups and 700 languages needed to be held together under one flag and one language.  These indigenous cultures were officially co-opted as caricatures rather than being allowed to grow organically.  The new official language was imposed very effectively at the expense of preserving local dialects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indonesia 2.0 began in 1998, with the toppling of Suharto, the country’s dictator of 32 years. This new era of reform and democratization has seen impressive stability and progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let’s talk about the best part of Indonesia - its people: warm, open-minded, easygoing and always lots of fun. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Flexibility&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indonesians are acrobats.  They’ve learned the hard way not to trust the system, but also to rarely challenge it. So they find resourceful ways of solving problems, relying on each other and adopting an optimistic, can-do attitude in any circumstance. Flexibility, elasticity and teamwork are key in nearly every walk of life, and Indonesians prize the following traits:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Non-confrontation:&lt;/strong&gt; Indonesians put a premium on getting along and not making each other lose face. Confrontation is truly a last resort. Indonesians love group consensus as a solution to any debate. The outcome is not as important as the fact that the decision was arrived at inclusively.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Patience:&lt;/strong&gt; A favorite Indonesian phrase is “jam karet”, which literally means “rubber time”, suggesting that time is a flexible, unpredictable commodity. It’s common for Indonesians to arrive an hour late to a meeting, and just as common for their colleagues to accept this as routine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rule-bending:&lt;/strong&gt; If time is rubber, so are rules, which are meant to be delightfully broken. Fees are waived, timetables sped up, and restrictions ignored, all for the right payment, family member, or childhood buddy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Self-reliance:&lt;/strong&gt; In a society where very few people have health insurance, social security, or even life savings, mutual help is very common. If someone is very ill, the entire family and even neighbors pitch in to cover costs. If an uncle can’t afford his own motorbike, his son-in-law and two school friends will cover the down payment. If the government won’t fix an awful road, local residents mobilize their own resources to get the job done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Corruption&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indonesians are fundamentally good, honest people born into a system that is utterly corrupt. So deeply rooted is the graft that just to get things done, one must either be corrupt or play along with corruption. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corruption is therefore a double-edged sword: it’s totally unjust and results in exorbitant costs, but it also allows people to get things done easily and quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indonesians resent paying huge bribes just to start up a small, legitimate business, yet love paying $25 to obtain an instant drivers license instead of the official $10 with its days of bureaucracy and road tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some cynically view low-level corruption as a tax system in a non-tax-paying society  Since the government cannot afford to pay police or teachers a livable wage, traffic cops demand petty bribes from drivers wanting to avoid hefty official fines, while teachers will accept payment to give students passing grades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Pleasure&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you thought this is a conservative nation of Muslim puritans, think again. Indonesia is a surprisingly hedonistic society that could teach America a thing or two about the “pursuit of happiness” and pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indonesians sometimes have it rough - with poverty, poor health, traffic jams, and pollution - but they constantly and unapologetically compensate themselves for these hardships. In Western countries, salons and spas are for the affluent, while in Indonesia even slum dwellers set aside the time (and as little as 50 cents) for a cream bath scalp massage or foot reflexology at a local spa shack. Infidelity, drugs and prostitution are rampant across all social classes in Indonesia.  Why?  Because people enjoy it, and deny themselves very little. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Religion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See all the young women wearing headscarves on the streets? Muslim extremists? Not even close. In fact many probably work as office girls for multinational companies and might even join colleagues at a karaoke lounge at night. Indonesia is a constant interplay between surface and substance, and nowhere is this more apparent than in the confusing, paradoxical attitude toward religion. The country is a cradle of “nominal Islam” – around 85% identify themselves as Muslims, yet very few are religious in the orthodox sense.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government dictates that every citizen must belong to one of the country’s six official religions, and this gets listed on every Indonesian’s ID card.  But for most Indonesians, religion is more of an identity label, security blanket or family tradition than a matter of orthodox belief or practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These official religious labels mask over society’s far deeper influences: pre-Islamic animist and Hindu roots, folk superstitions, and possibly more time spent worshiping English football matches or pop stars than praying in mosques or churches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Openness&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indonesians take humble pride in their own culture and achievements, but are incredibly open to outside influence. (Unlike the Thais, for example.) They are very welcoming and adaptive toward foreigners.  There’s no xenophobia here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This extends to the business world too: foreigners have been welcomed into many of Indonesia’s largest conglomerates as both senior directors and shareholders, while many have started major local companies of their own. This open-minded society has resulted in an open market full of opportunity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This openness may explain why travel is booming.  Indonesians are increasingly traveling overseas, interacting more intensively with the world and global economy.  Indonesian expats are returning from years overseas to participate in the nation-building at home, becoming local entrepreneurs, academics, NGO types, lawyers, etc.  And Indonesians are suddenly eagerly touristing locally, discovering their own country in a way they never did before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Future&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The future looks bright for Indonesia. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been three democratic, peaceful regime changes in the 15 years since the big reform, and no real fear that Indonesia will return to dictatorship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indonesia is today the most democratic country in Southeast Asia, having surpassed more “progressive” neighbors like Thailand, the Philippines and Malaysia. (Just fifteen years ago, Indonesia would have trailed far behind.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite criticism of the current government - which in itself is a breath of fresh air - President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono managed to steer the economy very skillfully, attracting huge foreign direct investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Indonesia, one must always look beyond the surface at the substance. It’s easy to be intimidated by corruption, traffic and pollution. But those frustrations are merely superficial distractions in a country that is unbelievably welcoming and more open for business than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Understanding Japan</title>
    <id>http://sivers.org/jp14</id>
    <updated>2014-01-19T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <published>2014-01-19T00:00:00+00:00</published>
    <link href="http://sivers.org/jp14"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This essay is adapted from an excerpt of the (great and highly recommended) book “&lt;a href="http://www.kirainet.com/english/a-geek-in-japan-the-book/#author"&gt;A Geek in Japan&lt;/a&gt;” by my hero &lt;a href="http://www.kirainet.com/english/"&gt;Héctor Garcia&lt;/a&gt;.  It is the first chapter of my new &lt;a href="http://woodegg.com/jp"&gt;Japan 2014 book&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If three Japanese people are talking together, and a fourth one joins the conversation, he will apologize upon approach for breaking the harmony of the group.  Why?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In Japan, everything looks like it works to perfection.  People do what they’re supposed to.  Trains run well.  Everybody has a job.  Everybody has money to live.  It has one of the lowest crime rates in the world.  Children study well and are some of the best in the world.  Tokyo is one of the cleanest cities you’ll ever see despite being the largest urban area in the world.  It seems to be a perfect place.  How have they achieved this?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
To understand the Japanese way, you must understand a few concepts that are deeply rooted into the culture.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Samurai role model&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The samurai adhered to a way of life, ethics, rules, and a code that spread to all branches of society, and even today affects the way Japanese think.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buddhism taught them to stay calm and patient.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Confucianism taught them that relationships between people are the basis of society - to respect our ancestors, relatives, and superiors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loyalty, justice, and honor are central.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sincerity, compassion, courtesy, and honesty are important key values.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Though the samurai no longer exist, this way of viewing life is ever-present in society.  Students are loyal to their teachers.  Workers are loyal to their companies, putting in long overtime hours.  Japanese are loyal, honest, sincere, and disciplined at work.  They follow rules and try to improve themselves every day, just as the samurai did in their time.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
A high compliment is the word “iki” (粋).  You say a person is iki if they are original, calm, refined, and sophisticated, without being too perfect, complicated, or self-conscious.  It’s similar to the word “elegant” or “graceful”.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;“Honne”, “tatemae”, and no “no”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Honne (本音) refers to the opinions and true feelings that everybody has.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Tatemae (建前) refers to social obligations, and opinions that have been adjusted to be socially acceptable - when words and true intentions don’t fully coincide.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
What someone really thinks is “honne”, but what they actually express is “tatemae”.  In Western countries we could call it hypocrisy, but in Japan knowing how to express tatemae and honne at the right time is considered a virtue.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
From the Western point of view, concealing the truth may be looked on with disfavor, but in Japan, preserving harmony is more important.  That’s why true thoughts (honne) are not expressed in a straightforward way, for fear of hurting people’s feelings.  It’s used to ease relationships and business, where established conventions have to be followed.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Japanese hardly ever use the word “no”.  Using it is considered very curt.  Instead, there are many ways to say “no” delicately, such as, “A little bit…,” or “This is very interesting,” or “We will study your proposal,” or “This is complicated but…”  When someone says these things, they are very politely but clearly telling you “no”.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
An example: Imagine you want to buy a ticket and there are no seats left.  The ticket salesperson won’t give you a straight answer like, “There are no tickets left.”  Instead he will probably keep you waiting, pretending he is looking into something on his computer, make weird faces, and say something like, “Finding seats can be difficult.”  This is tatemae at its best.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Modesty and humility&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
No matter what their social class, talent, studies, or job, Japanese people are expected to behave with modesty.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The most typical way to show our humility is by diminishing our own achievements while praising those of others.  If someone tells you that your recent work has been great, you must answer that the credit is not yours, that the latest successes have been achieved thanks to what your boss and company have taught you.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
If someone is too ambitious or flaunts their power too much, he ends up being ostracized by his company and society.  There are many cases where a person of great promise was too ambitious, and his/her superiors reassigned him/her to tasks such as serving tea in meetings or even cleaning the company bathrooms.  The Japanese see ambition as a threat to the inner balance of the system, which might bring them down in the future.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The way of elegance and perfection&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A deep-rooted Japanese concept is “do” (道), which means “the way”.  Look at many of the Japanese words we use in English.  “Judo” is the gentle way.  “Aikido” is the way of the union of spirit and mind.  “Dojo” is the place of the way.  There are hundreds of words with the character “do”, so it’s not merely a character but a whole philosophical concept and a way of life that has been deeply rooted in Japanese thinking for centuries.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Here is one important application of this concept:  it is very common to seek perfection in some tasks as a means to acquire spiritual satisfaction.  Education is repetition, following the set path, “the way”.  Through repetition of certain patterns, they get to be very good at what they do.  But this also makes it very difficult for them to depart from their routine.  Now you can see why Japanese companies have a reputation for being slow to change and avoiding innovation.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In individualistic societies (America, Europe, Australia, etc.), the common belief is that if you pursue your own self-interest this will automatically help with the interests of your society.  In Japan, the belief is reversed.  If you give your utmost in your work to serve your company, customers, and society, then this will automatically serve your own self-interest.  This is why Japanese companies are known for having such incredible customer service.  This helps you have a better life, and in turn you help others have a better life, while benefitting companies and the Japanese economy in general.
&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Same word. Different places? Different meanings.</title>
    <id>http://sivers.org/quality</id>
    <updated>2014-01-16T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <published>2014-01-16T00:00:00+00:00</published>
    <link href="http://sivers.org/quality"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;
I had just moved to Singapore when I met the brilliant &lt;a href="http://www.plus8star.com/"&gt;Benjamin Joffe&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/benjaminjoffe"&gt;@benjaminjoffe&lt;/a&gt;) - a startup consultant and investor from France, who has spent the last 13 years living around Asia: a few years each in &lt;a href="http://woodegg.com/kr"&gt;Korea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://woodegg.com/cn"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://woodegg.com/jp"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I asked him if he could tell me the most important thing he learned from living in these different countries.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
He said, “&lt;strong&gt;Even though we are all using English as a common language, the same word can mean very different things in different places&lt;/strong&gt;.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I looked confused, so he said, “&lt;strong&gt;When I say the word ‘quality’, what do you think it means?&lt;/strong&gt;”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I thought and said, “Quality means &lt;strong&gt;it works&lt;/strong&gt;.  It’s well-built.  It will last.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
He beamed a big smile and said, “Exactly!  I knew you were going to say that, because you’re American!  If you ask almost any American what ‘quality’ means, they’ll say ‘it works’.  To you, that’s the definition of the word, but it’s actually just the American definition of the word.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“In &lt;a href="http://woodegg.com/kr"&gt;Korea&lt;/a&gt;, if I ask almost anyone what quality means, they’ll say, ‘&lt;strong&gt;it’s brand new&lt;/strong&gt;’.  In Korea, newness is important.  Don’t go to Korea trying to emphasize the timeless long-lasting quality of your product.  What matters is what’s new.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“In &lt;a href="http://woodegg.com/jp"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;, if I ask almost anyone what quality means, they’ll say, ‘&lt;strong&gt;it’s perfect - zero defects&lt;/strong&gt;’.  Japanese culture emphasizes the importance of striving for perfection.  I saw a company ship a huge box of their products to Japan, but the shipment was not accepted because the shipping container was dented.  Although the items inside were fine, it was no longer a ‘quality’ shipment, since it was no longer perfect.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“In &lt;a href="http://woodegg.com/cn"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, if I ask almost anyone what quality means, they’ll say, ‘&lt;strong&gt;it gives status&lt;/strong&gt;’.  &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanxi"&gt;Guanxi&lt;/a&gt; is everything - your standing in a personal network - so any item that gives you social status is considered quality.  It doesn’t matter if it’s well-built or will last, as long as it raises your social status.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
He waited while I digested this thought.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Then he said, “This is why you can’t just take your brilliant American business idea and go make it happen in any country.  ‘Quality’ is just one word, but imagine the different cultural meanings of words like ‘music’, ‘romantic’, ‘friends’, or even ‘fun’!”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;This conversation is a big reason I started my &lt;a href="http://woodegg.com/"&gt;Wood Egg book series&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;  Understanding the different mindsets of different cultures has interested me ever since, so it’s fun to keep diving deeper and deeper into the subject.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Later, I asked a Singaporean friend why high-tech always-online &lt;a href="http://woodegg.com/sg"&gt;Singapore&lt;/a&gt; has almost no online shopping.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
He said, “Shopping is something you go out and do with your friends!  A few companies have tried to popularize online shopping in Singapore, but it has never worked.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
When I explained how it would save people a lot of time and money to being able to buy anything at home, without having to go out to the mall, he smiled and said, “What if I came to America and tried to start a company that helped people stay at home and get drunk alone, while sitting at their computer, so that they didn’t need to go out to bars with friends anymore?  Wouldn’t that save them a lot of time and money?”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Touché.

If you know you’ll never go to Asia, you can skip this.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
If you’re looking for a travel guide, you can skip this.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
But if you might do business in Asia, have thought about moving to Asia, or just want to understand the cultures of Asia, you will love this.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;16 books about moving to and doing business in 16 countries in Asia:&lt;/strong&gt;

They’re all &lt;strong&gt;ebooks for under $10 each, sold at LeanPub, Amazon, and Apple iBooks.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Plus this year there’s &lt;a href="http://woodegg.com/aa"&gt;a 17th book, combining all 16 books into one massive 4448-page ebook&lt;/a&gt;, for easy comparison between different countries.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Please &lt;strong&gt;go to &lt;a href="http://woodegg.com/"&gt;woodegg.com&lt;/a&gt; to check them out now.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
These 2014 editions were &lt;strong&gt;all written in the last three months, based on research from the last six months.&lt;/strong&gt;  They’re the most current and thorough guides of their kind.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The 2013 editions were OK, but I never promoted them because I wanted them to be deeper, more thorough, and more insightful.  But these 2014 editions were created by some amazing researchers and writers, so I can now proudly say these books are really very good.  (I’ll save the superlatives for future editions, since we’ll be re-writing them every year - an annual improvement process.)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I’ll have more to say about them in the coming weeks.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
But for now, I just want to say &lt;a href="http://woodegg.com/"&gt;they’re here&lt;/a&gt;.  Two years of effort by over 140 people.  I’m so thrilled, and honestly a little in awe of what we’ve created.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I hope you &lt;a href="http://woodegg.com/"&gt;buy one&lt;/a&gt;, and hope you like it. &lt;strong&gt;Click any book cover, below, to jump to the page for it.&lt;/strong&gt;

    <title>Jac Holzman</title>
    <id>http://sivers.org/jac</id>
    <updated>2013-12-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <published>2013-12-24T00:00:00+00:00</published>
    <link href="http://sivers.org/jac"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;
I met Jac Holzman the same day I met Bill Gates, but Jac made a much bigger impression, and he’s been my friend and mentor ever since.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Jac Holzman is a living legend.
He founded &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elektra_Records"&gt;Elektra Records&lt;/a&gt; in 1950.
(Yeah! 1950! Let that soak in a minute. That’s years before rock music was even invented!)
He signed artists like The Doors, Carly Simon, Harry Chapin, and Judy Collins to their first record deal.
In 1964, he founded the amazing &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonesuch_Records"&gt;Nonesuch Records&lt;/a&gt;, too.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
He’s done a lot more than that, so you can &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jac_Holzman"&gt;read his Wikipedia page&lt;/a&gt; for more.
He was inducted into the Rock &amp;amp; Roll Hall of Fame, so &lt;a href="http://www.rockhall.com/inductees/jac-holzman/bio/"&gt;there’s a good biography of him on their site&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
About 10 years ago, a mutual friend (the brilliant &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_L._Nash"&gt;Michael Nash&lt;/a&gt;) said Jac wanted to meet me, so we set a lunch date a couple weeks in advance, because I wanted to read his autobiography first.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I was deep in the middle of running CD Baby.
Business was booming almost out of control.
It was a little lonely, because all my friends are musicians but the stuff I was going through — trying to lead a company of 85 employees and thousands of clients — was something that none of my friends could relate to.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
But when I read Jac’s book, &lt;strong&gt;it was like I had been walking a mountain path alone, then came upon a cabin with the diaries of someone who had walked that track 50 years earlier.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Everything I was going through, he had gone through 50 years ago.
Keeping musicians happy, managing crazy employees, satisfying the needs of music lovers, navigating a booming music business — I thought it was just me, but nope.
Jac had been there and done that.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The book is called “&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0966122100?tag=sivers-20"&gt;Follow the Music: The Life and High Times of Elektra Records in the Great Years of American Pop Culture&lt;/a&gt;.”
I spent 16 kindred hours in his head, reading that 400 page book, before we finally met.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I was nervous before our lunch.
I expected him to be aloof on a pedestal, while I fawned over him in awe.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Instead, he bounded up to me, warm as can be, giving me a big hug, saying he was so honored to meet me, and had been looking forward to our lunch for weeks.
To this day, I think it’s one of the warmest greetings I’ve ever had from anyone.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
We talked for hours about music, and had lots of questions for each other. 
It was awesome.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Jac has these enormous blue eyes.
It’s amazing to think about what his eyes have seen.
Not just Jim Morrison showing up drunk on his doorstep and all of that.
&lt;strong&gt;This world of modern music that has been my whole life — Jac was right there in the middle of the creation of it.
The stories and the characters are mythical legends to me, but recent memories to him.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
He’s a real music and audio afficianado.
He always puts the music and musicians first, whether it later made money or not.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
He has this great story about needing to get the Beatles’ permission to license something from them in the 60s.
He met with them and asked.
George said, “Elektra Records? Didn’t you put out &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koerner,_Ray_%26_Glover"&gt;Koerner, Ray &amp;amp; Glover&lt;/a&gt;?”
When Jac said yes, John said, “Anyone who puts out Koerner, Ray &amp;amp; Glover is OK by us,” and gave his OK.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
He later told me that it was actually a long-term strategy of Elektra.
That sometimes he’d release records by amazing artists, knowing they’d probably lose money, because not only was it the right thing to do, but other successful artists would later choose to sign with Elektra instead of another label, because he had proven that Elektra would support their artistic exploration.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;(&lt;a href="/jac#ps"&gt;See my P.S.&lt;/a&gt;, below.)&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I look up to him so much that when he tells me to do something, I do it.
He’s the one that told me to go to New Zealand, the first time.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
He tried to get CD Baby to work with Warner Music at one point, which was a nice gesture, though not the best fit.
Still it led to some priceless moments like sitting around the pool at the Beverly Hills Hotel, talking with a shirtless &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyor_Cohen"&gt;Lyor Cohen&lt;/a&gt;, smoking a cigar.
(No, he didn’t use a hundred dollar bill to light it.)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Jac is such a perfectionist, always insisting that everything is the best possible quality it can be.
From his early hands-on audio recordings in the early 1950s — bringing his equipment on his back on his Vespa, recording in musicians’ apartments — to 2013 when he just spent countless hours making &lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/the-doors/id609344635?mt=8"&gt;The Doors iPad app&lt;/a&gt;.
(It’s an incredible labor of love.  If you have an iPad, absolutely &lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/the-doors/id609344635?mt=8"&gt;buy The Doors app now&lt;/a&gt;.)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Clearly, we hit it off so well that we made a point of meeting up every month or so after that.
He’s an avid hiker, so many times we’d go on long hikes up the hills of Los Angeles.
He was impressed I could keep up with him.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;There’s no conclusion to this story.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I called Jac just now while writing this article, and he wanted to hear all about how my wife and baby are doing.
Warm as always.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Ever the perfectionist, he said I should sit on this article for a few weeks, and have a few editors read it, but for once I’m going to disagree.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Go &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0966122100?tag=sivers-20"&gt;get his autobiography of the Elektra years&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=jac+holzman"&gt;search YouTube for Jac Holzman&lt;/a&gt; to see some great interviews and such.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/JacHolzman-600x300.jpg" width="600" height="300" alt="Jac Holzman photo"&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Jac Holzman then and now. Both at home with a microphone.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/JacHolzman-600x359.jpg" width="600" height="359" alt="Jac Holzman photo"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ps"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;P.S.  One more story:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
When I was 16, I heard this album called “&lt;a href="http://www.nonesuch.com/albums/bali-music-from-the-morning-of-the-world"&gt;Music From the Morning of the World&lt;/a&gt;”.
It blew my mind.
It changed my life.
I listened to that album over and over again all year, and a hundred times since.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Because of that album, I got interested in Asia in general, and Bali in particular.
I swear it’s to blame for a lot of my life’s journeys.
So &lt;strong&gt;24 years after hearing that album, I finally booked my flight to Bali.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The night before I left, Jac called out of the blue to say hi, and ask what I was doing.
I said I was packing to go to Bali, and how it’s something I’ve always wanted to do, since I was 16 and heard this record…
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Then I stopped.
Wait.
Wasn’t that album on Nonesuch Records?
Yes! It was!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I said, “Jac! &lt;strong&gt;I’m going to Bali because of YOU!&lt;/strong&gt; Because of the obscure record of Balinese Gamelan music you put out in 1967, I moved to Asia, and now I’m about to go to Bali for the first time because of you!”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Ah, the loops and circles of life.
&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why am I here?</title>
    <id>http://sivers.org/here</id>
    <updated>2013-12-20T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <published>2013-12-20T00:00:00+00:00</published>
    <link href="http://sivers.org/here"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;
Looking around the room.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“Why am I here?”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
It’s a useful question to ask often.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Either it will &lt;strong&gt;re-focus&lt;/strong&gt; your reasons for being where you are, or it will make you realize your reasons have &lt;strong&gt;expired&lt;/strong&gt; and you should be somewhere else.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In a little apartment in Singapore, I ask it again.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“Why am I here?”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Because of the brilliant and fascinating people here.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;(But I’m refusing all requests to meet, to stay focused on my work.  For the past 3 years I was very social, but now I’m not.)&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Because I love learning about Asia, and Singapore is a great central home base for that.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;(But I’m not exploring Asia right now.  For the past 3 years I was, but now I’m inwardly-focused on my writing and programming.)&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Because I love and admire it, and it feels like home.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;(But I’ve loved everywhere I’ve lived, from California to New York to London to Portland.  They’ve all felt like home.  Future places will feel like home, too.)&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Because I’m here right now.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;(But there are airplanes.  You can sit in them.)&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Most of us are where we are because of decisions we made years ago.  But are those reasons still current for what we need now?  Ask again.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“Why am I here?”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Damn.  I ran out of reasons.  I should be somewhere else.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I want silence, solitude, and wide open spaces.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I want to work all day while listening to nothing but birds and wind in the trees.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I want an intentional lack of distractions, far far away, to cure my tendency to say yes to intellectually stimulating events.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
So the answer was clear.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I moved to New Zealand’s South Island.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.newzealand.com/int/nelson/"&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; I am.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“Why am I here?”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
To work.  To focus.  To write.  To code.  To launch.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Yes. Good answer.
&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why my code and ideas are public</title>
    <id>http://sivers.org/ws</id>
    <updated>2013-12-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <published>2013-12-12T00:00:00+00:00</published>
    <link href="http://sivers.org/ws"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;
Over dinner my friend Valerie said, “I’m not worried about someone finding out my secrets, because secrets are just facts, right?  So if someone is going through my private things, for example, and gets upset about what they find, then that’s their problem, not mine!”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I liked that attitude, and kept thinking about it.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Later as we were leaving, I helped her put on her coat, and picked up her purse.  It was so heavy, I had to ask, “What’s in here?”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
She said, “Oh probably my two big diaries.  I have one diary that’s private, and another that’s like super-super private.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Because of what she just said about secrets, I had to ask: “Can I read the super-super private one, then?”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
She was a little shocked, thought for a few seconds, laughed, and said OK.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
We got two ciders and she patiently waited while I spent 20 minutes reading through it.  Pages filled with words about processing family drama, formulating goals, plans for life changes, romantic details, lists of regrets, contemplations, etc.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I was surprised &lt;strong&gt;it was all meaningless to me&lt;/strong&gt;.  These pages meant the world to her, but to me they meant no more than any non-secret conversation we’d ever had.  It was the same stuff that we all think.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Later, I thought about the stuff I keep secret.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Like my programming code, for example.  I had it locked in an SSH-only server, on an encrypted partition.  My current life’s work.  Super-super private.  Can’t let anyone get access to this!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
But what did I think would really happen if someone read my code?  They’d steal it and thrive?  &lt;a href="/multiply"&gt;Really?&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Then I realized it’s like Valerie’s diary.  Meaningful to me.  Meaningless to others.  So why go to the trouble to keep it so secret?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;(I realize there’s an argument on the other side.  Why go to the trouble to make it public?)&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
But life is an ongoing experiment, so &lt;strong&gt;I decided to make all my programming code and business ideas public and open source&lt;/strong&gt;, just to see what happens.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I wanted to &lt;strong&gt;challenge that fear that someone is going to steal our ideas&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Actually all those business ideas have been posted freely on my site for over two years now, and nobody has “stolen” them, yet.  You’re welcome to try.  I’ll keep adding more.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Everything is listed at &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://sivers.org/projects"&gt;http://sivers.org/projects&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.  Enjoy!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;P.S. I never said everything should be public.  I only said I’m making my code and ideas public.  That’s all.&lt;/strong&gt;  This is not about what &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; should make public or keep secret.  Everyone has different criteria.  It’s worth re-evaluating the choices you’ve made, to see if they’re still applicable to you.
&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OK, Milt Olin, I’ll start writing again</title>
    <id>http://sivers.org/milt</id>
    <updated>2013-12-09T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <published>2013-12-09T00:00:00+00:00</published>
    <link href="http://sivers.org/milt"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;
Last night I spent far too much time tinkering with setting up both the &lt;a href="http://www.freebsd.org/"&gt;FreeBSD&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.openbsd.org/"&gt;OpenBSD&lt;/a&gt; operating systems to dual-boot on my laptop.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This morning I found out one of my best friends died yesterday.  He was in great health, was out on a bike ride on a quiet street, and a car swerved into the bike lane, &lt;a href="http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2013/12/08/bicyclist-struck-and-killed-by-sheriffs-radio-car-in-calabasas/"&gt;killing him instantly&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I let him share my online music account.  He had just downloaded the entire Bruce Springsteen and Neil Young catalog yesterday before he left on his ride.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I’ve been crying off and on all morning, thinking about the things we do with our time.  What’s worthy and what’s a waste.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
It really is limited.  We can’t pretend it’s not.  Time spent doing one thing is time spent not doing something else.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
It’s so easy to waste time doing that stuff that’s of no importance, no challenge, no benefit to anyone, not even yourself.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
It’s so hard to fight the &lt;a href="/book/WarOfArt"&gt;resistance&lt;/a&gt; to do the more difficult but more important thing.  Finishing that book.  Writing that song.  Launching that project.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I spent this morning thinking about what doesn’t matter (like dual-booting FreeBSD and OpenBSD) and what does.  For me, &lt;strong&gt;writing&lt;/strong&gt; is about the most worthy thing I can do with my time.  I love how the distributed word is eternal - that every day I get emails from strangers thanking me for things I wrote years ago that helped them today.  I love how those things will continue to help people long after I’m gone.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
So this lesson is dedicated to you, Milt.  I’m going to start writing again.
&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fragile Plan vs Robust Plan</title>
    <id>http://sivers.org/robust</id>
    <updated>2013-06-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <published>2013-06-15T00:00:00+00:00</published>
    <link href="http://sivers.org/robust"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;
When I &lt;a href="http://sivers.org/eg"&gt;first had the idea for Wood Egg&lt;/a&gt; - publishing 16 books about 16 countries every year - I thought I would write them all &lt;strong&gt;myself&lt;/strong&gt;.  Visit 16 countries for 3 weeks each, doing intensive research the whole time.  That’s 48 weeks, so I could do it again each year.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
… But I had a baby on the way, so that idea lasted about a minute.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Then I thought of &lt;strong&gt;a journalist&lt;/strong&gt; I know who would love that kind of life.  I asked, she said yes, she flew to Singapore, and started working.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
… But it was a really bad fit, so after five weeks, we called it quits.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Then I decided to hire &lt;strong&gt;one writer per-country&lt;/strong&gt;.  16 authors to write 16 books.  This went OK at first.  &lt;a href="http://mohitpawar.com/about/"&gt;Mohit Pawar&lt;/a&gt; did a great job with India, and &lt;a href="http://www.cameronkeng.com/about/"&gt;Cameron Keng&lt;/a&gt; did a great job with Taiwan.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
… But the people I hired for the other countries flaked out, so I realized this plan was still too fragile.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Making a Robust Plan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I really wanted this to work.  I had to be smart.  I had to make a better plan.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I re-read my notes on &lt;a href="http://sivers.org/book/EMythRevisited"&gt;E-Myth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://sivers.org/book/WisdomOfCrowds"&gt;The Wisdom of Crowds&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://sivers.org/book/Crowdsourcing"&gt;Crowdsourcing&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://sivers.org/book/HereComesEverybody"&gt;Here Comes Everybody&lt;/a&gt;.  (In fact, I re-read &lt;a href="http://sivers.org/book"&gt;my notes on ALL 130 books&lt;/a&gt;. It was an enlightening week.)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I learned a few things:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you want help, it helps to get specific.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A plan that’s too dependent on any one person is too fragile.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Getting Specific:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Before, I had a very vague outline of what I wanted the book to cover.  I asked the authors to include sections on culture, government, business setup, hiring, banking, and marketing.  That was it.  The details were up to them.  Go!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In hindsight, I can see how daunting it was.  Too wide open.  I’ve written about the need to get specific before - (see “&lt;a href="http://sivers.org/get-specific"&gt;Get specific&lt;/a&gt;” and “&lt;a href="http://sivers.org/restrictions-will-set-you-free"&gt;Restrictions will set you free&lt;/a&gt;”) - but I had forgotten to apply it to this.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
So I spent a couple weeks and &lt;strong&gt;came up with &lt;a href="http://woodegg.com/in#toc"&gt;200 specific questions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.  Now, to write the book, we just had to answer those 200 questions.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
It’s infinitely easier to find someone to answer a specific question than to find someone to impart wisdom on a vague topic.  It &lt;strong&gt;puts the burden on the asker&lt;/strong&gt;, to come up with a good question, and &lt;strong&gt;lifts the burden from the answerer.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Multiple People:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So that the book was not dependent on any one person, and the book was not one person’s opinion, I made a system where each of those 200 questions had to be &lt;strong&gt;answered by three different people&lt;/strong&gt;.  Ideally, one local, one foreigner, and one other.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
16 countries × 3 researchers = 48 people.  I used &lt;a href="https://www.elance.com/"&gt;Elance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.odesk.com/"&gt;oDesk&lt;/a&gt; to find people in each country.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Of course, some disappeared, some never finished, and a few gave bad answers, but that was OK.  Life happens. People’s circumstances change. I understand. But it won’t hurt my plan.  If any one person is gone, I can still carry on.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
When all 200 questions had 3 answers each, (16 × 200 × 3 = 9600 answers), I hired a few writer/editors to combine the answers into one essay per question.  Again, one person disappeared, but it was easy for another to step in.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
And that was the robust plan that got it &lt;a href="http://woodegg.com/"&gt;done&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;(Note: I was also visiting every country myself, and contributing my own research to the books. But it was important that the plan didn’t require me, either.)&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Lessons learned?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you’re starting a project or company:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t expect anyone to care as much as you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t require them to think as hard about this as you have.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do expect them to change their mind and disappear.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make a robust plan that includes #1-3.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;As the founder, the burden is on you to come up with a great plan, to lift the burden from the people helping you.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Then, when you find some &lt;a href="http://sivers.org/book/Linchpin"&gt;brilliant people&lt;/a&gt;, it’s a great bonus, instead of an absolute necessity.
&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Wood Egg (my new company)</title>
    <id>http://sivers.org/eg</id>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;
Like everyone, I can get deeply curious about something, and dive in.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Starting five years ago, I got deeply curious about the differences between countries and cultures, fascinated with understanding the different perspectives. I talked about a few fun ones in &lt;a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/derek_sivers_weird_or_just_different.html"&gt;this 2-minute TED talk&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
So two years ago, &lt;a href="http://sivers.org/singapore"&gt;I moved to Singapore&lt;/a&gt;, and started visiting all the countries in Asia, asking dumb questions, making good friends.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Getting to know these countries is endlessly interesting.  I want to understand them as well as I understand the 50 U.S. states.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
But my learning felt too unstructured.  So while walking around Yogyakarta, Indonesia, remembering “&lt;strong&gt;the best way to learn something is to teach it&lt;/strong&gt;”, I came up with an ambitious plan.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I decided to produce and publish &lt;strong&gt;16 books per year on 16 countries in Asia&lt;/strong&gt;: Cambodia, China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Mongolia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Sure, they wouldn’t be great at first, but I committed to &lt;strong&gt;improving them every year for many years&lt;/strong&gt;.  After a few years of doing this, they should be pretty awesome.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Instead of being all-encompassing, I decided to focus just on entrepreneurship: a network I was already tapped into, a good filter for understanding a country’s culture, and a subject that may be useful to others.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
What to name it?  That only took a minute.  I like &lt;a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2003/06/naming_a_busine.html"&gt;Seth Godin’s advice about naming&lt;/a&gt;.  The &lt;strong&gt;E&lt;/strong&gt;ntrepreneur’s &lt;strong&gt;G&lt;/strong&gt;uide?  E… G…  Egg!  Golden Egg?  Too cliché.  &lt;strong&gt;Wood Egg?&lt;/strong&gt;  Yep!  Sounds like an exotic carved Thai or Indonesian treasure.  Good enough.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I set up a Singapore corporation for it from my Yogyakarta hotel room that night in August 2011, and began the next day.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
And now, &lt;strong&gt;after a year and a half of work&lt;/strong&gt; - (and some hard lessons learned that I’ll write about soon) - &lt;strong&gt;they’re done!  So my new company is launched:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://woodegg.com/"&gt;Wood Egg - the entrepeneur’s guides to Asia&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://woodegg.com/"&gt;woodegg.com&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Please check it out.  And if you’re also interested in this subject, &lt;a href="http://woodegg.com/help"&gt;see the help wanted page&lt;/a&gt;, because I’m starting on the 2014 guides immediately.

    <title>Some will always say you're wrong</title>
    <id>http://sivers.org/wrong</id>

Some people are into money.  Some aren’t.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Some people are inspired by helping the needy.  Some aren’t.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Some are into fame, power, and prestige.  Others are into anonymity and freedom from responsibility.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
It gets more interesting when you realize people have different preferences in the different parts of their life.  Famous online, but anonymous in their local community.  Generous with time, stingy with money.  Introvert when working, extrovert when not.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
You have to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://sivers.org/grade"&gt;know your preferences well&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, because &lt;strong&gt;no matter what you do, someone will tell you you’re wrong&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
If you’re not into money, many people will say you’re foolish.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
If you’re not into charity, many people will say you’re greedy.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
If you’re not into crowds, many people will say you’re missing out.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Some careers come with excuses:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The classic novelist thrives in solitude.  Alone in a cabin in the woods, writing books that reach millions.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The classic journalist thrives in a crowd.  Talking with everyone, building the story from a thousand accounts.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The shy librarian.  The aggressive lawyer.  The flaky artist.  No explanation needed.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;But some careers need explanations when you go against the mold:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The entrepreneur who’s not into money.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The musician who avoids crowds.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The ambitious conservationist.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The artist into discpline.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The &lt;a href="http://sivers.org/book/HowToGetRich"&gt;rich poet&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
But if you &lt;strong&gt;expect this criticism in advance&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;take pride in your stance&lt;/strong&gt;, you can bash on with a smile, being who you want to be.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Then every time they say you’re wrong, that’s a sign you’re doing it right.
&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>No rules in this game</title>

Everyone thinks you have to move to the big music cities. But Mihkel Raud in Estonia sold thousands of albums, 100% independent, without leaving Estonia. &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00007MB39"&gt;Rondellus Sabbatum&lt;/a&gt; was an album so unique that word-of-mouth sold thousands, with hardly any promotion.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Everyone says you need to make your music appeal to the masses. But Regina Spektor proved that emphasizing your quirks gets you further. &lt;a href="http://www.cdbaby.com/artist/ReginaSpektor"&gt;Listen to her early albums from 2001 and 2002&lt;/a&gt;. She was being more mainstream fit-the-mold piano vocal. But the weirder she got with &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycum4o6jlzQ"&gt;Soviet Kitsch&lt;/a&gt;, the more remarkable and noteworthy she became, and that’s when her career really took off.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Everyone is worried about piracy, copyright, and trademark. But &lt;a href="http://www.jonathancoulton.com/"&gt;Jonathan Coulton&lt;/a&gt; writes a song a day, gives most away, and is one of the most successful independent artists today. By making more and more music, and letting it flow, his music has gotten into unusual places like webcomics, audiobooks, comedy shows, and others’ YouTube videos. He disclosed that he makes about $500,000 a year by licensing, touring, donations, and people choosing to buy his music from his site, even though they could get it for free.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Because the music business is mostly perception, and minds are irrational, you can really have some fun with the counter-intuitive pop-psychology of it.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
A great way to win fans is to target a sharp niche - to &lt;a href="http://sivers.org/proudly-exclude-most"&gt;proudly exclude&lt;/a&gt; 99% of the public. So the way to win fans is to exclude almost everyone.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
A great way to get funding is to act as if you’ll never get funding - to make &lt;a href="http://sivers.org/good-biz-plan"&gt;a plan that doesn’t need it&lt;/a&gt;. So the way to get funding is to ignore funding.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
A great way to have a serious career in music is to take nothing seriously. Do the opposite of other musicians. Make up your own game.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Gurus will say what you must do or can’t do. They mean well, but they’re wrong.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
For every rule they tell you, there’s an exception. &lt;strong&gt;They are just telling you their specific past, not your specific future.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
There are no rules in this game. You change them as you go.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This was my contribution to Andrew Dubber’s great book, “&lt;a href="https://leanpub.com/360deal"&gt;The 360 Deal: A collection of genuinely helpful advice for people starting out in the music industry&lt;/a&gt;”. You should buy it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Seeking inspiration?</title>
    <id>http://sivers.org/io</id>
    <updated>2013-04-14T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

The word “inspiration” usually means something that mentally stimulates you.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
But “inspiration” also means to &lt;a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/inspiration"&gt;breathe in&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The meanings poetically combine when you think of yourself breathing in thoughts, filling your body with ideas.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
But don’t forget to breathe out.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Some people watch hundreds of &lt;a href="http://www.ted.com/speakers/derek_sivers.html"&gt;TED talks&lt;/a&gt;, looking for inspiration.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Tech entrepreneurs visit &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/"&gt;Hacker News&lt;/a&gt; every few hours, looking for new inspiration.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Musicians, writers, artists, and everyone else, all scouring the world for inspiration.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Breathing in, and in, and in, and in.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Yet most of them aren’t feeling inspired enough.  They’re looking for more, thinking something else out there will truly inspire them.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Want to know why?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Because nothing is truly inspiring unless you apply it to your work.&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;em&gt;(“work” meaning your life’s output, whether creative, business, or personal.)&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In other words, &lt;strong&gt;your work, itself, is the inspiration.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
You may hear something or see something that gives you a new idea.But it’s only when you stop and think of your work through this new perspective, that you actually &lt;strong&gt;jump up and go turn the idea into reality.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;That’s the real inspiration that everyone is looking for!&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The inspiration is not the receiving of information.  The inspiration is &lt;strong&gt;applying&lt;/strong&gt; what you’ve received.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
People think that if they keep reading articles, browsing books, listening to talks, or meeting people, that they’re going to suddenly get inspired.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
But &lt;strong&gt;constantly seeking inspiration is anti-inspiring.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
You have to pause the input, and focus on your output.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
For every bit of inspiration, use it and amplify it by applying it to your work.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Then you’ll finally feel the inspiration you’ve been looking for.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Breathe in. Breathe out. Breathe in. Breathe out.
&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Great Movies</title>
    <id>http://sivers.org/ebert2</id>
    <updated>2013-04-06T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <published>2013-04-06T00:00:00+00:00</published>
    <link href="http://sivers.org/ebert2"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;
A friend I hadn’t heard from in years called me out of the blue yesterday, and just said, “Dude... did you hear?”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I went home and before she even saw me, my wife asked from the next room, “Babe... I heard the news. Are you OK?”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
They all know I’m a fan of &lt;a href="http://www.rogerebert.com/"&gt;Roger Ebert&lt;/a&gt;. He died yesterday.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I was also a massive James Brown fan, but I wasn’t as affected when he died, because it’s not like I was tuning in weekly to hear what new music he was making.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
But Ebert... ooof....
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Every Friday since 1994 (yes 1994), I’d go to rogerebert.suntimes.com to read his new in-depth film reviews. I feel like I’ve been in his part-time film school class for the last 19 years. My life is so much richer from it.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This is going to be a hard habit to break.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Every time we’d watch a movie, I’d go back and read Ebert’s essay on it, to get a different perspective. My wife would joke, after the credits rolled, “OK, now go find out what Ebert said about it. I know you want to. I’ll wait.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“The Great Movies” was his collection of films he felt were the best. Years after his initial review, he’d go back and watch it at least once more, then write a deeper essay about it.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
A few years ago, I subscribed to Netflix and put all 300-or-so of “The Great Movies” in my queue.  We’d watch one or two a week, not reading his essay until afterwards.  I've seen most but not all of them now.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
A hidden world opens up to you when you dive deep into an art form.  Years of studying jazz at Berklee School of Music opened up that world to me.  Art is so much deeper when you get the contexts and references.  Ebert single-handedly did that for me for movies.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Someone recently &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/cekj0/roger_ebert/"&gt;asked him&lt;/a&gt;, “Do you think a more innocent viewpoint, not marred by technical knowledge, leads to a more ‘pure’ watching experience - the emotional elements without being distracted by technicalities?”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
He answered, “The more movies you see and write about, the more you know about them. Consider baseball. The ‘innocent’ crowd member sees a bunch of guys running after a little ball while wearing funny costumes. The Cubs fan sees inevitable tragedy unfolding.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
So, yeah.  I recommend you watch as many of these movies and read as many of these 364 essays as you can.  Especially the ones you think you’d be least likely to enjoy.  I’ll keep the links here permanently.
&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Learning JavaScript - my experience and advice</title>
    <id>http://sivers.org/learn-js</id>
    <updated>2013-03-25T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <published>2013-03-25T00:00:00+00:00</published>
    <link href="http://sivers.org/learn-js"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;
Since I've &lt;a href="http://sivers.org/prog"&gt;mentioned&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href="http://sivers.org/os"&gt;few&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://sivers.org/srs"&gt;times&lt;/a&gt; that I just learned JavaScript over the last few months, a bunch of people have emailed to ask what I used and recommend to learn it. So here's my experience and best advice for 2013.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
NOTE: I wanted to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; learn JavaScript - not shortcuts, quick tricks, or meta-tools&lt;/strong&gt; that keep me from having to learn JavaScript. I want to learn it, get it, read it, understand it, and memorize it, so that I can understand all the other cool things written in JavaScript for years to come.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
First - a bunch of people will tell you to get &lt;a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596517748.do"&gt;JavaScript: The Good Parts - by Douglas Crockford&lt;/a&gt;. But when I started reading it, it was so dense and succinct that I had no idea what it was talking about!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
You know when an expert is talking about their field, and don't know how to simplify it for just anyone? Well, this book felt like it'd be perfect for someone who's been programming for 20 years in C, Java, and C++, and just needs a quick overview of what they should know about JavaScript.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
But it doesn't really TEACH you. It doesn't guide you through anything. So I recommend skipping it.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Instead, &lt;strong&gt;start with &lt;a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/"&gt;Eloquent JavaScript - by Marijn Haverbeke&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
It starts so simple, so easy, almost too simple, but this is encouraging. You get your swagger back as you say, “This is easy!”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html"&gt;Do the online version, here&lt;/a&gt;, because you can test and experiment directly in your browser.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Then, after a few chapters of that, &lt;strong&gt;switch over to &lt;a href="http://www.wrox.com/WileyCDA/WroxTitle/Professional-JavaScript-for-Web-Developers-3rd-Edition.productCd-1118222199.html"&gt;Professional JavaScript for Web Developers, 3rd Edition - by Nicholas Zakas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;THAT is the ultimate tutorial.&lt;/strong&gt; It takes the time to explain everything thoroughly, and it covers pretty much everything. Put aside a few hours per chapter, and &lt;strong&gt;by the time you're done with this one book, you'll know as much as most people who call themselves JavaScript programmers.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Funny thing is, I went back to &lt;a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596517748.do"&gt;JavaScript: The Good Parts&lt;/a&gt; after finishing this one, and now I understood it. But because &lt;a href="http://www.wrox.com/WileyCDA/WroxTitle/Professional-JavaScript-for-Web-Developers-3rd-Edition.productCd-1118222199.html"&gt;Professional JavaScript for Web Developers&lt;/a&gt; was so thorough, it had already covered all of the “good parts”, too.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Of course &lt;strong&gt;you have to retain what you're learning&lt;/strong&gt;, so I highly recommend you &lt;strong&gt;write down every new thing you learn&lt;/strong&gt;, ideally into a flashcard program, &lt;a href="http://sivers.org/srs"&gt;like this&lt;/a&gt;. It's a lot to take in, so you'll have to remind yourself of what you've learned in the weeks and months afterwards.
&lt;/p&gt;
If you're in the mood for more books to really solidify JavaScript in your head, go through:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596806149.do"&gt;JavaScript Cookbook - by Shelley Powers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://effectivejs.com/"&gt;Effective JavaScript - by David Herman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.manning.com/resig/"&gt;Secrets of the JavaScript Ninja - by John Resig and Bear Bibeault&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
All of these are great, and you'll notice you go through them much faster now that you're fluent. Do the examples. Play around.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Read some real-world JavaScript code&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
After a thousand pages of tiny example code snippets, you'll love looking at the code to two very popular and powerful JavaScript projects:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://underscorejs.org/docs/underscore.html"&gt;Underscore.js&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://backbonejs.org/docs/backbone.html"&gt;Backbone.js&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You'll notice that it all makes sense, now. You're now functionally fluent in reading and understanding JavaScript.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Then jQuery, and more...&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href="http://jquery.com/"&gt;jQuery&lt;/a&gt; is absolutely everywhere, and you must learn it for your JavaScript tutorial to be complete.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Now that you've learned the plain-JavaScript long and verbose way of doing things, you'll appreciate the shortcuts that jQuery provides.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I really liked &lt;a href="http://www.headfirstlabs.com/books/hfjquery/"&gt;Head First jQuery&lt;/a&gt;, as goofy as it is. It walks you through jQuery wonderfully well, and has you apply what you've learned, as you go.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
And if you're still hungry to learn more JavaScript, dive into:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://coffeescript.org/"&gt;CoffeeScript&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920024309.do"&gt;The Little Book on CoffeeScript - by Alex MacCaw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://backbonejs.org/"&gt;Backbone.js&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="http://javascriptissexy.com/learn-backbone-js-completely/"&gt;following this path&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://nodejs.org/"&gt;Node.js&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="http://javascriptissexy.com/learn-node-js-completely-and-with-confidence/"&gt;following this path&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Then put down the books and go use it!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You would think this goes without saying, but if I didn't say it, someone would complain. So look at your existing sites, and go apply what you've learned.  Or start a new site from scratch and make it all with JavaScript, even if just as an experiment.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Any other suggestions? What worked for you?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Well... that's what I did, and I'm quite happy with the results.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Please share any other suggestions or experiences, here:

    <title>Human Intervention as a Competitive Advantage</title>
    <id>http://sivers.org/hi</id>
    <updated>2013-03-21T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <link href="http://sivers.org/hi"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;The listening algorithm&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A year after I started CD Baby, when it was still just me in my bedroom, the CEO and VP of a hugely-funded Silicon Valley online music company contacted me, saying they wanted to fly out to New York to meet me.  I said OK, and we met a week later for dinner.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Dinner was a lot of blah blah blah smalltalk, and I wondered what they really wanted.  Then they finally got to the real point:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“The reason we flew out to meet you is because we’ve been looking at many music recommendation engines, and the one that’s powering cdbaby.com is one of the best we’ve found.  Could you tell us a little something about the algorithms and data points you’re using?”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Uh...  I was confused, and asked what they meant.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
They said, “The «if you like this you will like that» recommendations. We’ve been testing them on your site, but they don’t seem to be sales-driven like Amazon. The music-matching algorithm comes up with incredible recommendations. What software are you using for that?”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Ah!  I get it.  I smiled and pointed to my ear.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“No software. &lt;strong&gt;I just listen to everything that comes in, and recommend other good stuff like it.&lt;/strong&gt;”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Now they looked confused.  “&lt;strong&gt;But how will that scale?&lt;/strong&gt;  You can’t just listen to every single album!  What will you do when you start getting a hundred albums a day?”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I said, “Maybe hire someone just to listen.  I don’t know.  I’m not there yet.  I’ll worry about it then.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
(And that’s what I did, when we were getting a hundred albums a day. The coolest full-time job in the world went to Pamela Rooney, who would listen to every new arrival, and do the internal recommendations.)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Minimizing or Maximizing?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;When everyone else is trying to automate everything, using a little human intervention can be a competitive advantage.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The problem is when business owners see it as a cost, instead of an opportunity.  &lt;strong&gt;Trying to minimize costs, instead of maximize income, quality, loyalty, happiness, connection, and all those other wonderful things that come from real human attention.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
You can buy a fancy phone routing system, so people have to listen to 9 options, choose option 5, then listen to 6 more options...
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
... or ...
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
... you can hire a charming person to pick up the phone on the first ring, and make a great impression.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Which one do you think will win you new fans?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
You can put rules into your online forms, so if someone puts a dash in their phone number, or writes “coming soon” as their URL, it tells them they’re wrong and makes them do it over again....
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
... or ...
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
... you can have new submissions be checked-over quickly by a real person.  It’s worth the 10 seconds of human effort, to &lt;strong&gt;keep the end-user experience easy&lt;/strong&gt; but the internal data correct.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
It’s fun for techies to try to find the tech solution to everything, but don’t forget that even a tiny touch from a real person can be the best alogrithm, and a massive business maximizer.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Who should do the work?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I get the mindset.  It’s saying, “By having our software and our users do most of the work, we can keep our business efficient and scalable.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
But if you want them to pay you, if you want to be more valuable, you have to &lt;a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/schlep.html"&gt;take on more of that work&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I meet so many entrepreneurs who are convinced their thing will be as big as Facebook, so they can’t afford to have a personal touch for all those BILLIONS of users that are going to start flowing through their app.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
But by removing all human contact, they’re making their app less valuable, so that they’ll never get big enough for it “how does it scale?” to matter.
&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Changing my operating system</title>

    <content type="html">﻿&lt;p&gt;
A few months ago, I did &lt;a href="http://foolishadventure.com/audio/derek-sivers-fa132/"&gt;an interview with Tim Conley from Foolish Adventure&lt;/a&gt; on the subject of “changing your operating system” - my metaphor for making deep changes in my life.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I got a bunch of emails from people who really seem to like it, so the brilliant &lt;a href="http://emarmusic.com/"&gt;Melissa Rebronja&lt;/a&gt; transcribed it, below.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;You can &lt;a href="http://sivers.org/file/fa132-derek-sivers-success-mindset.mp3"&gt;download the MP3 of the hour-long conversation, here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - or just read the transcript, below.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
He brought up some interesting subjects, so I'd love to hear your thoughts or feedback. Leave a comment here, or &lt;a href="mailto:derek@sivers.org"&gt;email me at derek@sivers.org&lt;/a&gt; anytime. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;section&gt;
&lt;header&gt;
&lt;small&gt;0:25&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Tim:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Welcome to another &lt;a href="http://foolishadventure.com/audio/derek-sivers-fa132/"&gt;episode of The Foolish Adventure Show&lt;/a&gt;. I’m your host, Tim Conley and I’ve got a very special guest here. Mr. Derek Sivers of CD Baby fame, who had sold his company in 2008, which we’re not actually gonna talk about here. There are plenty of interviews of Derek out there about the rise and the sale of CD Baby. But what we’re gonna talk about the time between the sale and now. This is going to be more of a mindset episode and not a how-to episode. So, what’s up Derek?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section&gt;
&lt;header&gt;
&lt;small&gt;1:00&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Derek:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hi Tim! What’s funny is that when I sold CD Baby, I thought that my greatest hits were behind me. You know like somebody who had a hit single in the 80s and that’s all they will ever be known for. I thought it would go onto my gravestone. “Here lies Derek Sivers. He made CD Baby and that’s about it.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Then &lt;a href="http://www.ted.com/speakers/derek_sivers.html"&gt;I spoke at all the TED conferences&lt;/a&gt;, a year after I sold CD Baby, and now I’m actually more known for that. As I go around the world, everybody’s like, “Hey, you’re that first follower dancing leadership guy from TED! Rock on Dude!” Then people sometimes ask, “So what do you do besides speak at TED?” That’s all they know me for now!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section&gt;
&lt;header&gt;
&lt;small&gt;1:45&lt;/small&gt;
Tim:
&lt;/header&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So the sale happened in 2008 and from the stuff that I heard you just wanted to decompress from that. So where did you go? What happened to Derek after the sale?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section&gt;
&lt;header&gt;
&lt;small&gt;2:00&lt;/small&gt;
Derek:
&lt;/header&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I don’t know if it was decompress as much as de-brainwash. In short, &lt;strong&gt;I wanted to change my operating system&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I think all of us have a way that we do things. Say when you’re like a teenager or early 20s, you’re constantly learning new things, growing, changing everything, deciding what your major is gonna be, then going out into the world and getting jobs, doing things, and changing wildly all the time.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Then people often hit a point in their 30s or so, where they just say, “Well this is who I am. This is the way I do things.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section&gt;
&lt;header&gt;
&lt;small&gt;2:37&lt;/small&gt;
Tim:
&lt;/header&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Ah, that just gave me shivers! Ah, that doesn’t feel good at all!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section&gt;
&lt;header&gt;
&lt;small&gt;2:41&lt;/small&gt;
Derek:
&lt;/header&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Yeah! You know, “This is the way I like my eggs. This is the kind of music I like. This is my favorite team. This is where I live. This is what kind of person I am. I’m a social person, or I enjoy a beer on a Friday. This is who I am.” And people get that weird kind of stuck.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Here’s a version of that in the music business: I would go to these music conferences and I’d be invited to speak on a panel. It’s always a panel. And the moderator would ask: “What is the future of the music business?” The guy who’s in the business of selling MP3s would say “The future is selling MP3s! People want to buy MP3s”, and the guy who’s in the business of streaming radio would say: “People don’t want MP3s! People just wanna turn on radio but have it world-wide.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Then they’d turn to me, and I was in the business of selling CDs and distributing things, so they’d expect me to say that the future is that. But all I could say is: “Look nobody knows the future. Nobody! Ben Bernanke doesn’t know the future of the world economy and he controls it! So even the people who control this stuff don’t know it. The record labels don’t know the future of the music industry and they somewhat control it. Nobody knows! And anybody who claims to know if full of shit and not to be trusted! Because they’re obviously not thinking clearly or being honest if they claim to know what the future is. Because they don’t. So if they’re opening their mouths and telling you what the future is, they’re lying. They’re not being honest. Or if they think they know, then they’ve deluded themselves or not thinking clearly.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I felt that at CD Baby &lt;strong&gt;I had been seeing the world through one point of view for 10 years&lt;/strong&gt;. I was immersed in my world of independent musicians mailing me a box of CDs directly and having me sell the physical CDs and distribute the digital files off to iTunes, Amazon, Napster, Rhapsody, etc. And that was my whole world for 10 years. I was very head-down at work on that.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The day I sold CD Baby, I went to sleep that night with an empty head and a big smile. I was like, “Wow! 10 years of my life. I’m done. I’ve moved on.” It was like graduation day. Wow, I just finished. I went to sleep that night so empty headed.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Then I woke up the next day, had breakfast and by lunch I had a great idea for my next company. And I started sketching it out. It’s called Muckwork. It’s gonna be this service firm, that’s like a professional network of assistants that are already pre-trained to help musicians with all the things that musicians need help with, so that musicians don’t need to kind of micro-manage them. They can just dump their problems on us and we’ll take care of it.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I was so excited about this idea that I immediately, like that day - January 18th is the day that I had the agreement to sell CD Baby, January 19th is the day that I woke up and had the Muckwork idea - (It’s kind of cute that you can see if you do the “whois” on the domain name, that everything was registered on January 19th, the day I had the idea.) Programming and coding, I registered the domain name, I did all the programming. I worked on that for a few months. I even hired a manager, and I was just about to launch it....
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Then I had the feeling that &lt;strong&gt;I hadn’t yet changed my operating system&lt;/strong&gt;. “If I do this, it’s going to be like CD Baby part 2. Like my life will not change!” Same guy doing the same thing in the same way, but just with a different company name over my head. I am too into the idea of personal growth and development to do something like that.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
So, I kind of just quickly looked at my situation before charging people’s credit cards and beginning. Once somebody pays me the first dollar, I’m on the hook to deliver. And wait a second: I don’t know if I want that yet. So, that’s when I kind of intentionally put the brakes on it. I let go of the manager I hired. Luckily he’d only been working for me for a few weeks, so it was no hard feelings. And I lifted my head up.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I often think of life as having different phases. Sometimes you’re just head down and just working. And then sometimes you lift your head up and look around and see what’s up.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section&gt;
&lt;header&gt;
&lt;small&gt;7:03&lt;/small&gt;
Tim:
&lt;/header&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So when you did this lifting your head up and taking a look around, doing a complete operating system reboot would be pretty difficult for any human, because we are so ingrained in our culture, our language, that sometimes even dictates our behaviours, and to do a complete reboot? What did you start with?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section&gt;
&lt;header&gt;
&lt;small&gt;7:23&lt;/small&gt;
Derek:
&lt;/header&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Reading lots of books. Lots of non-fiction books. Particularly a lot about psychology, behavioural economics, studies of happiness - which is a fascinating idea, I’d like to study it directly. Learning what makes people happy, and taking it to heart.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Y’know there’s a cognitive fallacy that we all have, where we think that statistics don’t apply to us. When you hear “9 out of 10 people bla bla bla” you think “Ha, well I’m that 1 out of 10” And we all have that. 90% of people think they are better than average drivers. People asked in a cancer ward in the hospital, 95% of cancer patients say that they are in better health than most cancer patients. So it’s amazing to think that 45% of them are wrong. Like half the people that think they’re better than average drivers are wrong! They are actually worse than average drivers!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Then having to look at myself through this new fact. I think this is what I mean about changing your operating system. It’s &lt;strong&gt;taking in new knowledge and actually living by it, applying it&lt;/strong&gt;. Not just reading and going “Hm, alright, well that’s interesting,” then going back to my normal way of doing things.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section&gt;
&lt;header&gt;
&lt;small&gt;8:39&lt;/small&gt;
Tim:
&lt;/header&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So to be able to apply that… Let’s take happiness. I find that very interesting because we all have concepts of what’s going to make us happy, even while we’re not currently happy. So we have that, and when you read something about how you can be happy, the act of being happy. How do you put that into your life? And this is from somebody who’s now technically retired, right? What did you do that you could make use of that knowledge? Build a framework? Or just sit back and think happy thoughts?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section&gt;
&lt;header&gt;
&lt;small&gt;9:11&lt;/small&gt;
Derek:
&lt;/header&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I guess that’s where your personal preferences come in.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Even in Buddhism, I never understood people who just sit in a temple on top of a mountain or under the Bodhi Tree and just sit there and smile. That’s not enough for me because I’d feel useless in the world if I’m just sitting there being happy. What’s amazing is that just a couple of months ago I went to Thailand, I didn’t even realize there was such a thing as active Buddhism. I’m not an expert on this, but apparently there is a whole chunk of people that believe in applied Buddhism, like this idea of be happy and go out and do things that improve the world. That it’s not enough to just sit there and be happy and meditate. Yes mediate, find your peace, and then go out and make the world a better place. So that’s the one that appealed to me more.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
But I felt like &lt;strong&gt;I needed to shatter my habits&lt;/strong&gt;. So my little mini slogan was, “Wherever you used to say ‘yes’ say ‘no’ and wherever you used to say ‘no’ say ‘yes’.” Reversing all of the things you used to do and trying the opposite.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section&gt;
&lt;header&gt;
&lt;small&gt;10:25&lt;/small&gt;
Tim:
&lt;/header&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I want everybody that’s listening to actually think about that right now. Think about what it would feel like to actually say “yes” to something that you would normally say “no” to. I guarantee you, there’s going to be a twinge of fear, because that’s scary as it can be.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section&gt;
&lt;header&gt;
&lt;small&gt;10:38&lt;/small&gt;
Derek:
&lt;/header&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Oh, absolutely! Well, that’s the whole point. If you’re not scared, you’re doing something wrong! The whole point is to find the fear.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I’ve had this slogan ever since I was a teenager. “&lt;strong&gt;Whatever scares you, go do it&lt;/strong&gt;.” I would use that even on a little micro level. I see the gorgeous girl across the room and I’m like “Ahhh!” terrified to talk to her! Then I remember, “Whatever scares you go do it! So here we go..” and I would just walk up to the girl that intimidates me and say hello. Then of course she’s wonderful or not, whatever it is, but I walk away no longer scared. Now I just have that approach through life. I think whatever scares you go do it, because then it won’t scare you anymore.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I had never had an interest in travelling. I had never had an interest in anything but working. I was absolutely - from the age of 14 until 38 - just a workaholic. In college my nickname was “the Robot”. The guys would tease me that I wouldn’t even join them for dinner. The cafeteria had free meals. I went to Berklee School of Music. Everybody would stop for an hour at 6:00 and hang out and eat whatever the cafeteria food was. But I would just breeze through there, and slap some peanut butter and jam on some bread, grab some carrots sticks and throw it in my backpack and head up to the practice room. Friends were like: “Dude.. Common man, hang out!”  But I'd say, “I don’t wanna hang out. I gotta work. I gotta practice.” I was always the first guy in the practice rooms in the morning and the last guy there at night. Everybody was going out to parties on the weekend and I would take that opportunity to read next year’s assignment, and do my homework in advance. So I was that guy that would get teased for never relaxing.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
So to me, the idea of going to India for a month and walking around and experiencing it was so against my grain, y’know? That’s not me! That’s not what I do! So, therefore that’s what I need to do.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
There were a bunch of examples that are like that. I just did a bunch of things that were not me, in the name of learning and growing, experiencing new things. The most obvious one that people point at is my wife.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I met this gorgeous girl in NYC. She was born in India, grew up in a Muslim family, and we had only been together a few months when I said, “Come out to California with me. Let me get you out of NYC. Come hang out with me there.”  Because that’s where I lived. That’s my place!  And she said: “Well I can’t. My Mom still thinks I’m a virgin. I can’t go with you unless we’re married.” I was like, “Hmm, married huh? I can do that.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
So we had a Muslim wedding. And to make her parents happy I said a few syllables. In fact I Googled “How to convert to Islam” and apparently all you have to do is say these two sentences. I just memorized them phonetically. It’s just “Ash hadu alla ilaha illallah. Ash hadu anna muhammadar rasulullah.“ You say that in front of another Muslim and you have now converted. That’s it. So I read that, and I was like. ”Pffft! I can do that!“ I’m cracking up. Oh wow, I’m gonna do that. This is ridiculous. I was like ”OK, here we go.“
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In the name of changing my operating system, it’s not like I’m gonna actually adopt new beliefs or anything like that but the change for me there was actually doing something that is not me to make someone else happy. I had never done that. I’m a California kid. I had always been so proudly, defiantly individualistic. I only do things for me. Always the rebel. So the idea of me, even just having that understanding how this would make her parents very happy. If I say these two sentences. It would let them tell the relatives back in India that their daughter had a proper Muslim wedding. Means nothing to me, it means everything to them. So here we go.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section&gt;
&lt;header&gt;
&lt;small&gt;14:56&lt;/small&gt;
Tim:
&lt;/header&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That’s something I’ve always had a problem with, is doing things that for some reason I am against, right? It doesn’t mean anything to me, so therefore I shouldn’t do it. And that it something I’ve struggled with, is opening up and allowing other people’s feelings to actually get into my life. And that is something that I still struggle with today, because I don’t actually see my self as actually that empathetic. To look at, oh, y’know what would this really mean to someone else and even further for you, for your wife. Yeah, you could understand it for her, but why that extra layer, y’know? The family, then even further afield, the family back home. For me, that’s always been a struggle.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section&gt;
&lt;header&gt;
&lt;small&gt;15:40&lt;/small&gt;
Derek:
&lt;/header&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I guess this is what fiction is good at. I don’t read a lot of fiction books, but I do watch a lot of movies. And when done right, the whole idea is to help you get into somebody else’s head really, and understand their process. I guess when fiction is done deeply and done well, when books often excel beyond movies that need to keep things kind of short and entertaining, it’s this idea of &lt;strong&gt;really getting into someone else’s head&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Like I don’t know right now whether you consider yourself liberal or conservative, but what’s fascinating is that all the places I lived were just extremely liberal. I lived in NYC, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Portland, Seattle. Y’know, all of the bluest parts of the bluest states, right? Then it was kind of cool starting to have friends, that were extremely conservative, and even going off on the whole Obama birth certificate thing. Having those people actually be friends of mine, that I love and care about. It’s kind of fascinating to get into the whole different mindset. Because it’s not just about the president. It’s like a whole different world view of the way things should be. And getting back to traditional values and all that. Whereas I’m always trying to get rid of traditional values. And how do you even stay dear friends with somebody that looks at the world in different ways? Well, you get into their head.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I guess we all have different sides to ourselves. Like, even if you’re 99% a certain way, like say introvert/extrovert or something, most people will say: “Well I’m kind of both. I’m mostly introvert, but sometimes I like to go out and be with lots of people.” It’s kind of like that. You can understand the other way of looking at things, even if it’s a smaller part of you.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I guess now is a good time to transition into talking about world-travelling, huh?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section&gt;
&lt;header&gt;
&lt;small&gt;17:37&lt;/small&gt;
Tim:
&lt;/header&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Yeah, because having a world view and having it change. That is something that impacted me as well, when I left home. I couldn’t wait to leave home. I grew up in rural southern Illinois. And I knew that the world was awesome, because I could see it on TV.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section&gt;
&lt;header&gt;
&lt;small&gt;17:52&lt;/small&gt;
Derek:
&lt;/header&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And then you found out you were allowed to leave!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section&gt;
&lt;header&gt;
&lt;small&gt;17:54&lt;/small&gt;
Tim:
&lt;/header&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Yeah. But I grew up really not knowing how to leave. And my only thought was: “Oh, I’ll join the military.” So I looked around at what was available for militarily service. I was like OK, I don’t wanna be on the front lines, so the Marines and Army are out. I don’t wanna be stuck on a ship with a bunch of dudes for six months, because I like the ladies a little too much, and back then there were very few women deployed on the ship. And didn’t want to join the Coast Guard, because well that wouldn’t get me overseas to a certain extent, and I didn’t want to be involved in the drug war, because that’s pretty dangerous living too. And so that left the Air Force. So I joined the Air Force to travel the World, and they sent me to Texas and then to Arizona. And I had to travel on my own dime.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
But one of the great things that really helped me out was that I grew up in a very racist area of Southern Illinois called… Southern Illinois! LOL. I always knew there was something wrong with racism. I didn’t know what it was, but I alway knew there was something wrong with it. And then I got into the military, and it was fantastic. Because I met the very first Puerto Rican man I’d ever known and he was just a couple of bunks away from me. Met my first Filipino man. And being able to become very close friends with Blacks, Hispanics, Asians, it was amazing. It was one of the most eye opening experiences of my life. That really rebooted my operating system, because I knew mine was kind of broken. And then I got into that one and then the military said. “Oh no, you’re not going to act like that. That is un-acceptable behavior in this environment,” and it was amazing. I loved it. And so then world travel really broke some of the cultural scripts that I had been ingrained with growing up.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
So did you travel a lot up until you said you were working a lot? So did you travel much when you sold the company?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section&gt;
&lt;header&gt;
&lt;small&gt;19:57&lt;/small&gt;
Derek:
&lt;/header&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
No. I had the lucky benefit of when I was 5 years old, we lived in Abingdon, England for a year, because of my Dad’s work. And while we were in England we spent a lot of time in Sicily, Madrid and Paris.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
At the age of 6 I moved to Hinsdale, Illinois, about 25 miles outside of Chicago. That’s where I went to grade school and high school and stuff. So I guess you can say that’s mostly where I kind of grew up.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
When I moved from England to Hinsdale, even though I considered my self a California kid, I had an English accent from living in England for a year. Everybody called me “the English kid”! I was like (in an English accent): “I’m not from England, I’m from California! Mummy, tell them. Oh God, I hate England! No I’m from California!”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
So I guess I’ve always at least had an awareness that there’s a world out there that you could actually live in and not just vacation in.  But no, except for that thing when I was 5 years old, I had not travelled at all.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I travelled a lot around the US. I lived a few years each in Chicago, Boston, New York, Woodstock, Portland, Santa Monica, San Francisco and Seattle.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
But when you’re in America, you feel that you’re at the center of everything. Because whether it’s Hollywood, the media, every movie, every TV show, everything is set in America. Everybody has American accents, except for the occasional odd foreign film or something.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section&gt;
&lt;header&gt;
&lt;small&gt;21:15&lt;/small&gt;
Tim:
&lt;/header&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And all the aliens invade the United States!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section&gt;
&lt;header&gt;
&lt;small&gt;21:19&lt;/small&gt;
Derek:
&lt;/header&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Exactly! That’s where they go, they’re not invading Uruguay. So, you can feel you’re in the middle of everything.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
What’s amazing is that after leaving, culturally and in many ways, I realizes America is off on one far extreme of whatever chart you make. America is a very extreme end of things. One extreme end it’s not the middle.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
So I was almost 40 years old, and I had really spent my whole life in the US, except for that one year when I was 5. So that was a big inspiration for me.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I’m on this mission to change the way I think, and move ahead in life instead of getting stuck in ruts. Especially when you sell a company and it’s like “Now I’m rich.” It’s so easy to just get stuck in a rut and be the cliché guy either drinking his margaritas for life or being the sad ex-success. Like somebody who had a big hit long ago and now is just stuck in those glory years. Y’know? The 80s musician trying to do things the 80s way still.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;I wanted to make it impossible for me to get stuck in a rut. So my mission was to spend the rest of my life outside of the US, mainly because I loved it too much.&lt;/strong&gt; Santa Monica in particular. When I got to Santa Monica, I just felt “This is it, I have arrived. Like I love this place. I love these people. I love the food. I love the weather. I love everything. This is it. This is my home. This is where I belong.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
But that feeling kind of scares me, because it’s like that thing when people get to a certain age and say “This is who I am. This is how I like my eggs. This is where I live.” I didn’t feel it was time to stop progressing, even in my physical location. So my challenge to my self is to live the rest of my life outside the US, because I love California too much.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I went to New York City for 3 days, passing through for a friend’s wedding, and I met this gorgeous girl and we had this great first date, we’re all swooning over each other. So on our second date I said, “How would you feel about leaving the US and never coming back?” She looked at me for a second, kind of squinted and said, “Yeah, I could do that.” And so then we had a third date and that’s my wife.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
She’s joined me on this mission to spend the rest of our life out of the US, even if it’s uncomfortable. Even if it’d just be the easy and comfortable thing to just go back to Santa Monica to what I know well. It’s the idea of kind of forcing yourself to keep progressing. And so far we’ve only lived in pretty comfortable places. I mean we’ve lived in Singapore…
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section&gt;
&lt;header&gt;
&lt;small&gt;24:40&lt;/small&gt;
Tim:
&lt;/header&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
… one of the most modern places in the world!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section&gt;
&lt;header&gt;
&lt;small&gt;24:44&lt;/small&gt;
Derek:
&lt;/header&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Yeah, exactly! Everybody speaks English. She grew up in NYC, so Singapore’s another big city. It’s very easy and comfortable for her. The bigger challenge is the idea of this being a stepping stone to the idea of living somewhere like Brazil or Taiwan, and the idea of staying long enough until even that feels like your comfort zone. Can you imagine?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Right now I don’t speak Portuguese, I don’t know hardly anything about Brazil. But could you &lt;strong&gt;imagine what it would do for your life to move down there and put up with some initial discomfort and stay until it becomes your comfort zone&lt;/strong&gt;, so that Brazil just feels like home? And Portuguese - you’ve forgotten that’s it’s your second language, cause it feels like your first, and all your friends are there, and you get it, and the mindset feels like your comfort zone?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
And even better, that once you get to that point, &lt;strong&gt;then you do it again&lt;/strong&gt;. Then you go to Taiwan. And at first it’s uncomfortable and it’s difficult, and then you slowly adapt and then it feels like home. And then you go to Berlin and do it again.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section&gt;
&lt;header&gt;
&lt;small&gt;25:51&lt;/small&gt;
Tim:
&lt;/header&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Yeah, I found that when traveling I get drawn to comfort zones, where expats are everywhere. When you’re totally out of your element, like my first trip into Asia, I’m as shiny white as can be, and I was about a good 6 inches taller than everyone around me, and I was just being stared at. I’m riding on a bus in rural Sri Lanka and I’m being stared at and touched. It was a really weird experience. So that culture shock really drew me to hanging around other travellers, because it felt comfortable. Even though Americans try to pretend like we’re not much like the Europeans, but we’re very close. As soon as you travel you find out just how closely aligned we really are. And I’m hangin out with Europeans and everything and I’m thinkin’ “Oh man, how cultural of me” right? Where I’m hangin’ out with a guy from France and a woman from Germany and all this yet not hanging out with the people that I actually came to see.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
So, how do you break from that comfort zone when you’re travelling?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section&gt;
&lt;header&gt;
&lt;small&gt;26:56&lt;/small&gt;
Derek:
&lt;/header&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I think the main difference is to &lt;strong&gt;really live somewhere instead of visiting somewhere&lt;/strong&gt;. I mean you could do it short term, you could just make yourself talk to people that you’re perhaps intimidated by and give the patience to get deeper.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I think whenever you first talk to somebody that’s very different from you, the first you thing you notice is difference in looks. You talked about racism, and the funny thing about racism is that you only notice somebody’s race for the first few minutes. Then it just disappears, and then you’re just talking to a person.  If somebody would to say: “Hey, who was that Chinese guy that you were talking to?”, you’d think “Oh him?” You’ve almost forgotten their race, because it’s just a person.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Then to me the next level is the accent or the language differences. That takes a little longer to get past. To kind of hear through the language barrier and communicate heart-to-heart, despite your missing words or misunderstood vowels. Then you can do that when travelling. Like even if you just go somewhere for a week.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
When I went to India for the first time, at first I was terrified. Mostly thanks to a panic-stricken friend of mine who had been there once years ago and right before I left warned me that it was the most horrible place on Earth and that people are gonna be clawing at me and yanking money out of my pockets. Terrified me. So I went there with my guard up fully, right? Like prepared to be attacked. And I kind of hid at first. I hid in my hotel room. I’d go on little walks around then I’d go back to my hotel room and read a book.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
It wasn’t until my last week there that I pulled up my CD Baby database and I emailed some musicians that lived in Calcutta. “Hey I coming through Calcutta for a week, would you like to meet up?” Until then I was scared of doing that, y’know I just wanted to be alone. So I set up like three different meeting with three different musicians from Calcutta. And with each of the three people we sat around and talked for hours. Unfortunately it was my last week there. I wish it was my first week, because then I finally got it. Then I kind of felt like…
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section&gt;
&lt;header&gt;
&lt;small&gt;29:20&lt;/small&gt;
Tim:
&lt;/header&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
… it would’ve changed your whole experience had it been earlier?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section&gt;
&lt;header&gt;
&lt;small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
Derek:
&lt;/header&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Yeah! They spoke English. And, yes they had the accents, but y’know that disappears after a while. You hear through it after a while. We were sitting there having a really great heart-to-heart talk. It was this bass player from Calcutta and he was telling me about life in Calcutta, and the music scene there. Dude, I felt like I was hangin’ with somebody from Illinois. Y’know? It just felt as home as anything. And that was only just one week in India.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Now imagine that you decide to live somewhere, which is even a self definition thing. Like “I’m living here.” vs “I’m visiting here.” So when people say: “Where are you from?” you say: “Well, I live here now, but I moved here from the US” or something. It’s just a different status. But then it’s getting to know people deeper, having a circle of friends that you hang out with and you see each other every week. Get to know them dearly. Yes, they grew up in a very different environment than you, but you find your common ground. And this to me was the cool thing about it.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
So we &lt;a href="http://sivers.org/singapore"&gt;moved to Singapore&lt;/a&gt; two and half years ago. It’s an interesting hybrid where it has all the modern amenities. It has drinkable water and fast internet and stuff. It’s a very comfortable place to visit. Everything works. It will feel familiar enough.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
But man, under the surface, there are some deep world-view differences. Actually my best friends in Singapore are native Singaporean. They’re very Christian. They are very conservative. And the Asian mindset: It’s one thing to have somebody tell you the Asian mindset is more collective than individualistic. (I’ve heard that a lot in my life and I kind of went “yeah, yeah, OK, whatever. ”) But to really get to know that mindset and to have people that you know and care about tell you that they chose a profession that they didn’t want to do because it was good for the family. My first reaction as an individualistic American is to say: “No, that’s wrong. You gotta stand up for what you wanna do man. What you wanna do is important!” But to understand that no, that isn’t right. That’s one way of looking at things.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
That’s that whole thing I was talking about where America is kind of off onto one far end of the spectrum of individualism. Whereas a lot of the world values things much more by how good they are for the group. In Singapore in particular, the priorities are what’s good for your country and what’s good for your family. Only one or two generations ago, most people in Singapore were in poverty. It’s really lifted itself out of poverty in just a generation or two.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
So when the parents say: “No, you’re not going to be a poet, you’re going to go to a good university and you’re going to get a good paying job at a bank.” It’s kind of non-negotiable, because you’re expected to take care of your parents. There is no social security that’s going to take care of your parents when you’re older. It’s up to the children to take care of the parents. So if you say: “I’m just gonna follow my passion and be a poet,” you’ve just told your parents that they might die sooner than they would’ve if you could take care of them well. It affects the whole group. And so you do what’s best for the group, not just what’s best for you.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I thought of a good way to explain this to a friend of mine. A friend of mine was having a hard time understanding this where it all sounded too high-level. So I said, OK, imagine if you found a car unlocked and the keys were left in it. And somebody were to say: “Hey Dude, you should totally steal that car”. And you say, “What are you, insane?” Like that’s just wrong. Why is that wrong? Well because it’s bad for society. It’s not what you do. That’s stealing from someone else. &lt;strong&gt;You have to be a sociopath to think like that&lt;/strong&gt;. Well, that’s the way it seems to be too individualistic in Asia - you’re seen as somewhat of a sociopath. If you say: “Well yeah, I wanna be a poet, even though my parents want me to be a banker.” It’s a little bit like stealing a car and driving away. It’s just bad for the group. It’s bad for everyone. Why would you do this silly idea of following your dreams when you can do the thing that’s best for the group. You know what I mean?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section&gt;
&lt;header&gt;
&lt;small&gt;33:52&lt;/small&gt;
Tim:
&lt;/header&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Yeah. One of my closest friends in University was from Taiwan. Over some drinks he admitted to me that he was being very selfish, he was dragging out his college education. We were both in Architecture School together and he was dragging it out. He’s like: “I really have to graduate within the next couple of years, because I have to go back and I have to start adding to the family estate.” He’s like: “I’m the oldest and I’m also a son. I have a ton of responsibility on me, so right now I’m kind of leeching off the family right now.” And he felt really bad about it. And for me as an American, I’m like: “Whatever. Like why would you even think like that? That’s insane.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
It took me a while of being friends with him for several years to really understand just how much pressure he was under. Because here he is in the US to get a great education, but also being able to look around and say: “You know if I just stayed here, my life would be amazing.” But instead he knew he was going back to Taiwan and do his duty to his entire family. And I had huge respect for the guy by the time we finished school. I understood exactly where he was coming from and why it was important for him to go back and do what his family wanted. Even though he wanted something else that he could’ve got in the US.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section&gt;
&lt;header&gt;
&lt;small&gt;35:23&lt;/small&gt;
Derek:
&lt;/header&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Yes! And what’s so hard to get over as an American, is to not think that that’s wrong! Y’know? I still, I find myself - even right now as we’re just talking about it - cringing and still feeling like “That’s wrong! He should stand up for himself and do what’s best for him!” But no, hold on, hold on. That’s my American roots talking. That’s just one way of looking at things. That’s my American point of view.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
My whole mission of not living in the US again - it’s because I feel like I’m already about American as I can possibly be. I get it. I lived in five corners of America. And it’s true, I haven’t lived in Mississippi or Montana yet, but for the most part I get it. I get America about as much as anyone can. And now it’s time to push out of that. So it’s still hard for me to get over my American way of looking at things.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
What’s so cool, is to have dear friends now that are the opposite. When I talk about my individualistic things, they cringe because they grew up in India or Singapore, and for them it’s so hard to get over the feeling that individualism and following your passion is wrong, y’know? It’s so cool to be really close to somebody that sees it from the other point of view.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section&gt;
&lt;header&gt;
&lt;small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

&lt;/header&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section&gt;
&lt;header&gt;
&lt;small&gt;36:43&lt;/small&gt;
Tim:
&lt;/header&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So the time you spent in Singapore - I read your recent post about global thinking vs local thinking and you had decided you were really gonna think local in Singapore. Was this business or music focused or was it a little more holistic?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section&gt;
&lt;header&gt;
&lt;small&gt;36:57&lt;/small&gt;
Derek:
&lt;/header&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It was holistic. It was just everything. It was entirely like, “I live here now.” I’m a permanent resident of Singapore. It’s the equivalent of getting a Green Card in the US. I’ve got permanent residency in Singapore. I might even get citizenship someday. I’m here. So, I want to get to know my community. I want to be a part of the community, and just immerse myself totally.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
For the last two years, I’ve been totally immersed into the community of Singapore. Mostly just giving, in every way I can. I was immediately, upon moving here, tapped by every university, group, &lt;a href="http://hackerspace.sg/"&gt;hackerspace&lt;/a&gt; and everything, asking, “Come speak to our group. Come speak to our class. Come speak to this. Come speak here.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
So I did a lot of speaking, a lot of mentoring, and a lot of meeting. I had hundreds of one-on-one meetings. I spent a few thousand hours of the last couple of years just sitting down one-on-one with people. Mostly just letting them pick my brain.  It’s always somebody else initiating it saying, “I’d really like to meet with you. I have this idea for a business. Can I pick your brain?” and I would just always say yes, because it’s like well, this is my new home, so yes!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I did really most of the last two years. Online I appeared to be pretty silent. Online people would say, “Hey Dude, I haven’t seen a new blog post from you in like 4 months!” But it’s because every day, for 6 or 8 hours a day, I’m giving to my local community here. Meeting with everybody that wants to meet with me and letting everyone pick my brain. Speaking to every group that asks me to speak.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I think I finally had to admit slowly to my self that &lt;strong&gt;it was very one-sided&lt;/strong&gt;. Not 100% one-sided, because I definitely got something out of it. With every person I speak to, of course, I learn something as well. But the nature of the conversations, not quite as lopsided as this one where you said: “Can I interview you?” That’s designed to be a lopsided conversation. But sometimes they were almost this lopsided. Like people who had a bunch of questions that they wanted to ask me. Wanted to ask questions about what I had learned in life or from experience or whatever. So, I would do most of the talking unfortunately. But I would learn a little something about Singapore or about their mindset.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Then at the end of last year, I realized &lt;strong&gt;what I really need to do in my life is get back to the idea that I have paused for almost 5 years ago now&lt;/strong&gt; - that Muckwork idea that I was describing. Really, it’s still gnawing at me. I still think it’s worth doing. This company idea that I had the day after I sold CD Baby. I still wanna do it, and it’s been on hold for 5 years and it’s been gnawing at me. I really think that I need to stop doing all this one-on-one meeting, and I need to just focus on my work.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Around this time I read a few books that really helped speak to that feeling. The author’s name is Steven Pressfield, and he’s written 3 different books about this: “&lt;a href="http://sivers.org/book/DoTheWork"&gt;Do the Work&lt;/a&gt;”, “&lt;a href="http://sivers.org/book/WarOfArt"&gt;The War of Art&lt;/a&gt;”, and “&lt;a href="http://sivers.org/book/TurningPro"&gt;Turning Pro&lt;/a&gt;” They’re like three of a series, speaking to the same thing. He’s a novelist and he calls it &lt;strong&gt;“The Resistance”: That feeling like when you’re sitting down, “facing your demons”, forcing yourself to try to sit in that chair and work, even though everything in you just wants to get up and grab a snack or take a nap or watch TV or call a friend.&lt;/strong&gt; But no, you need to sit in that chair and wrestle through this difficult paragraph or chapter or idea or whatever it is.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Looking at my actions in that new light really, really resonated with me&lt;/strong&gt;. Like sometimes if you’re reading something and you hear some new bit of information you go “Hmm that’s interesting. I never thought about it that way before.” And other things you hear and they just hit you in the gut. Like yeah, that is something I’ve known and felt all along and just never put into words before.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section&gt;
&lt;header&gt;
&lt;small&gt;41:23&lt;/small&gt;
Tim:
&lt;/header&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Because you were resisting it!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section&gt;
&lt;header&gt;
&lt;small&gt;41:25&lt;/small&gt;
Derek:
&lt;/header&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Yes! And for five years now!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Like I told you earlier, how I had that company idea, the day after I sold CD Baby, I spent a few months on it but then I halted.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
We spent most of this conversation glorifying the world traveller, nomadic, adventure seeking culture of rebooting my operating system kind of life. But what’s kind of crazy is to &lt;strong&gt;look at that all again through a different lens now and realize that was all resistance!&lt;/strong&gt; Resistance against just what I really needed to be doing - to shut up, sit down, and get back to the really difficult work of creating something, and struggling through that painful resistance of making it happen instead of just leaping off to another country and learning another culture and having another conversation with another stranger.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The really difficult work can be to shut up, sit down, and do your work. So that’s where I’m at right now.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section&gt;
&lt;header&gt;
&lt;small&gt;42:34&lt;/small&gt;
Tim:
&lt;/header&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Ok Derek, so you’ve been battling this resistance of traveling and getting into new cultures. You’re saying it was mostly resistance. So, what’s that going to do now? How has that actually informed what you’re doing right now?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section&gt;
&lt;header&gt;
&lt;small&gt;42:48&lt;/small&gt;
Derek:
&lt;/header&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Well, I think there are some things you have to work through.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Like you just said that traveling inspires you and all that, and helps you be more creative. It’s true that all of this world traveling has opened my mind to many things and there is so much more to go. I feel like I just barely begun. I haven’t yet been to so many countries that I still can’t wait to understand more about. So, I feel like I’m just beginning.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
But most minimalists are people that used to have too much stuff, and they were pack rats or they were shopping freaks, and they got too much stuff. And then they felt the pain of having too much stuff, and then they got rid of it and felt the greater joy of realizing that you don’t need that stuff, right? So, I feel that way culturally.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Like the last few years I’ve just been like binging on the culture of the world, and not in a leisurely way, it’s actually been in a very focused working kind of way. In fact one of my first projects that I’m gonna be launching soon: For the last year I’ve been producing &lt;a href="http://woodegg.com/"&gt;16 books about doing business in 16 different countries in Asia&lt;/a&gt;. I’ve been to most of these countries recently, and interviewed a ton of people and gathered all this research and hired researchers and all this stuff. So I’ve been really binging on the cultures of the world.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
And now that I’ve been through that, I felt the pain of not having created anything. That’s what it took for me to get back to the point of where it’s like, yeah, I could go to yet another country, and meet yet another stranger and learn more about that, but I need to sit down and program.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I wanna make Muckwork happen. I have another idea called Songtest, which is like an open source song feedback contest. I had an idea called Cyrano, like a Cyrano de Bergerac tweet kind of thing for people who don’t wanna tweet for themselves. I wanna sit down and make that happen. Each one of these things, the way for me to make it happen is to &lt;strong&gt;sit down and program for a few weeks, or a few months, and launch it&lt;/strong&gt;. And then maybe lift my head up again, then probably keep my head down for a couple of years, and follow through. Get some momentum for it, and make it something that rolls on its own. That’s the hard work that I need to do next.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The question of where to do it becomes moot, because the focus is inward again instead of outward. So I can sit in my apartment in Singapore, I could rent a vacation home in New Zealand. If anything, I’m still banning my self from going back to the US for now. It’s still too familiar to me. It’s too much my comfort zone. Even though I’m inward-focused, I’d almost rather still be in Brazil, India, Sweden, or anywhere else. We’re talking from New Zealand right now. I’m in New Zealand now. I’m down here for a couple of months. One thing I like about New Zealand is it’s so far away from everything that it’s kind of like the antidote to the travel bug. Because when I’m in Singapore, there are so many fascinating cultures, just one hour away.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section&gt;
&lt;header&gt;
&lt;small&gt;46:18&lt;/small&gt;
Tim:
&lt;/header&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A little hop on a plane, right?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section&gt;
&lt;header&gt;
&lt;small&gt;46:20&lt;/small&gt;
Derek:
&lt;/header&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Yes! And not only that but with the discount airfare. For like &lt;a href="http://www.tigerairways.com/sg/en/real_deals.php"&gt;$65&lt;/a&gt; I can be in Bali, or Thailand, or Cambodia, or Malaysia, or Borneo. Ahh, it’s all right there and it’s so tempting. I rented a little vacation place for a few months down in New Zealand to fight the travel bug and stay focused. So that’s what I’m doing right now.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section&gt;
&lt;header&gt;
&lt;small&gt;46:44&lt;/small&gt;
Tim:
&lt;/header&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One thing you said that I really liked was how you hadn’t created. I think a lot of people have this hollow feeling in themselves where they know they could be creating - and some of them even attempt to do it through business - but it just doesn’t transfer. They fall prey to resistance. They don’t actually get it done. And that hollowness really ends up tainting their own world view. So how do you take that hollowness that you felt of not creating and turn it around, and actually make something from it?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section&gt;
&lt;header&gt;
&lt;small&gt;47:22&lt;/small&gt;
Derek:
&lt;/header&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Do the work. Shut up, sit down, fight the temptation to do other things, to follow your distractions, and just work.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Most of us know what we need to do&lt;/strong&gt;. That’s what’s crazy! I think in any field, any person, what you need to do is usually painfully obvious. We’re all searching for distractions or reading yet another book with yet some more advice. But no, we’ve heard enough advice, &lt;strong&gt;we’ve all got enough advice&lt;/strong&gt;. Really you already know what you need to do. It’s different for everybody.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
For me, it’s programming. In order for all of my ideas to happen, it has to start with the website. To me business is still art. It’s something that I create as a personal expression of something that I want to exist. So the idea of saying, “just hire somebody to program it,” is a little like telling the songwriter in the band to just hire somebody to write the songs for them. It’s like, “Well no, this is what I do. This is my art. I want to write the songs.” So, I still want to program my websites, my ideas.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I’ve never learned JavaScript before. Talking about changing my operating system - I’ve been doing nothing but PHP for 10 years. Then learning Rails. I’ve never touched JavaScript. It always was kind of a silly decoration until a few years ago - it always felt a little like an unnecessary flourishes.  Now it’s really become more core. So I picked up &lt;a href="http://www.wrox.com/WileyCDA/WroxTitle/Professional-JavaScript-for-Web-Developers-3rd-Edition.productCd-1118222199.html"&gt;a 1200 page book&lt;/a&gt; that everybody says is the best way to learn JavaScript. And I’m going through it, chapter by chapter, &lt;a href="http://sivers.org/srs"&gt;jotting down everything I’m learning into flash cards and memorizing it all&lt;/a&gt;, and spending hours a day just making little exercises for myself. Learning JavaScript with the idea of applying it to programming those ideas that I was talking about.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
So how do I combat that emptiness and feeling? It’s just willpower. It’s almost like meditation. Again, I’m no Buddhist, but when you learn about mediation first thing you hear is that yes, all of these distractions come into your head, and you’ll be sitting there trying to stay silent and focused and all of a sudden you’ll think about something that somebody told you yesterday, and you have to just learn to let it go - to say “&lt;strong&gt;OK, that’s just a distraction. I can let that go now&lt;/strong&gt;”, and to let it run back out of your head instead of doing something about it.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I think that a problem of our “always on, always connected” internet thing is that a lot of us, all day long, as soon as you have any kind of whimsy or curiosity or thought in your head, you immediately just type a Google query or go check on something. Let me just see how my friends are doing. Let me just check in. Let me make sure I’m not missing anything. Let me go look at &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/"&gt;Hacker News&lt;/a&gt; or whatever. It’s like mediation: feeling that urge and just saying, “Hello urge, I’m not going to acknowledge you. I’m busy, go away.” To just let it go and not act on it. I think it’s the biggest challenge for me right now.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section&gt;
&lt;header&gt;
&lt;small&gt;50:38&lt;/small&gt;
Tim:
&lt;/header&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Very cool. Very cool. So, any final words of wisdom you can give everybody listening? We’ve talked about mostly just a philosophical discussion and giving them just a little bit of what not to do. What can they do? What would you say to people that are ingrained in their life, in their culture, in their rut, but want something different out of life? What can you say to them?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section&gt;
&lt;header&gt;
&lt;small&gt;51:04&lt;/small&gt;
Derek:
&lt;/header&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Well, &lt;strong&gt;if you’re feeling in a rut, there are 2 ways out of it&lt;/strong&gt;, and we talked about both of them here:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Sometimes what you need to do is to &lt;strong&gt;change everything&lt;/strong&gt;, to just quit your job, move somewhere different. If you’re stuck in a bad relationship, get out of it. If you’ve been with somebody for too many years and it’s a bad relationship, get out and go be single. If you’ve been single for too many years, well then commit. Y’know? If you’ve been doing things one way for too long, do the opposite.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
But then the other way out of a rut - the last thing we just mentioned - is to finally have the willpower and discipline to &lt;strong&gt;do the thing that you’ve been avoiding all these years&lt;/strong&gt;. You know what you need to do. To understand that you really need to do it now. That your life is going to get worse and worse and worse if you don’t act on what you know you should be doing.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
For some people that means starting a company. For some people it means joining a company. For some people it mean making calls that they’ve been scared to make, or confronting their parents about something. Whatever it is, it’s usually the difficult, often long thing.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
It’s too tempting to say that it’s going to be a short thing. It’s like “Hey, just make that call that you’ve been meaning to make.” No, you need to learn that programming language that you’ve been meaning to learn, and it’s going to take you a year, y’know? &lt;strong&gt;It can often be that really long, hard, difficult thing&lt;/strong&gt;. How about like changing your eating habits? You’ve been eating crap, you need to start eating mostly vegetables, and it’s gonna be hard!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Sometimes I felt like when I was living my travel adventures, jumping off to these new countries and strangers, I often felt that what I was doing was very good for other people. That other people could say: “Wow, that looks so fun. What an adventure.” Whereas telling people no, I need to say no to the 20 people a week that want to meet with me, and say no to the many conferences that want me to come, and say no to all the projects people are asking me to join. And I need to say no to everything, and I need to sit here and spend 6 hours a day programming, and 3 hours a day writing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section&gt;
&lt;header&gt;
&lt;small&gt;53:24&lt;/small&gt;
Tim:
&lt;/header&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Ah, but that’s not glamorous.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section&gt;
&lt;header&gt;
&lt;small&gt;53:25&lt;/small&gt;
Derek:
&lt;/header&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Right! It’s not glamorous! &lt;strong&gt;It’s not interesting to others. It’s what needs to be done. It’s the more difficult thing.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
So only you know which of these two paths is your path out of a rut. It’s really tempting to think it’s the exciting quick fix adventure thing of hopping on a plane and quitting your job and breaking up your relationship. That’s fun but be really honest with yourself that maybe the thing to get you out of your rut is finally acting on the thing that you have been avoiding for years.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section&gt;
&lt;header&gt;
&lt;small&gt;53:57&lt;/small&gt;
Tim:
&lt;/header&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Fantastic, fantastic. Derek, it’s been a pleasure. I’m very happy to have been able to sit down and just chat with you for a while.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Can I get your philosophical view on the world and how that informs our business decisions?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section&gt;
&lt;header&gt;
&lt;small&gt;54:15&lt;/small&gt;
Derek:
&lt;/header&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I don’t know how much any of this refers to back to business!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section&gt;
&lt;header&gt;
&lt;small&gt;54:17&lt;/small&gt;
Tim:
&lt;/header&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Well, I think it does. I think everything we do in our lives, there’s no separation. I use the word business just to be able to say that there is this artificial separation, but what we do in our business is a part of our lives. It’s an active creation. It’s active, as you say art. You can’t separate the art from the artist. That’s why I love these kinds of philosophical mindset discussions. You can’t just go, “I just listened to Derek for an hour and now I can go and succeed in business.” That’s not what it’s for. What it’s for is to, as you said in the very beginning - change your operating system. Put a new program in there. And that new program in time could be the thing that actually helps you out in your business goals.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section&gt;
&lt;header&gt;
&lt;small&gt;55:07&lt;/small&gt;
Derek:
&lt;/header&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Yeah, definitely.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The one thing I mention in passing but I didn’t emphasize enough is the importance of reading books. Not just scanning articles. If you think about how many hours and hours you spend skimming articles and reading the news, that quick-fix kind of stuff. If instead, can you imagine if you didn’t do that but instead you put aside two hours a day to pick up some books that speak to something that you either don’t know anything about - like architecture - or to make you a deeper expert in something in an issue that you really care about? So often you learn so much more from that than you would just skimming around.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The idea of &lt;strong&gt;thinking something through deeper and then putting aside time to reflect on your perspective&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s one thing to just sit and read and read and read. Sometimes you need to put aside an hour and half to write your own thoughts about it. Internalize it instead of just taking it in and moving on.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Yeah, you’re right, so it’s inseparable, this whole business and personal thing. It’s funny sometimes when people would want to pick my brain about their business, and they’d say “&lt;strong&gt;Here’s my business idea, what do you think?&lt;/strong&gt;” and I’d be like “Um, I don’t know, &lt;strong&gt;what kind of person are you?&lt;/strong&gt;” It depends. Do you want some big IPO, or are you looking to get bought, or are you looking to have an adventure? Y’know? It depends on what kind of a person it is. You can’t just say “This is my business advice” until you know who the person is you’re speaking to.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section&gt;
&lt;header&gt;
&lt;small&gt;56:35&lt;/small&gt;
Tim:
&lt;/header&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Right, right.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section&gt;
&lt;header&gt;
&lt;small&gt;56:36&lt;/small&gt;
Derek:
&lt;/header&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And thanks for mentioning that’s it’s inseparable.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section&gt;
&lt;header&gt;
&lt;small&gt;56:37&lt;/small&gt;
Tim:
&lt;/header&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Again, I really appreciate it, and I know you’ve got to get your head back down, and back to work.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section&gt;
&lt;header&gt;
&lt;small&gt;56:44&lt;/small&gt;
Derek:
&lt;/header&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Yeah!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section&gt;
&lt;header&gt;
&lt;small&gt;56:45&lt;/small&gt;
Tim:
&lt;/header&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And I need to do the same over here. So same thing with all the listeners, I want you to go out, and after you’ve taken some time and reflected on your life and put your head down.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section&gt;
&lt;header&gt;
&lt;small&gt;56:56&lt;/small&gt;
Derek:
&lt;/header&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And enjoy your foolish adventure.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

    <title>It's all who you know?</title>
    <id>http://sivers.org/xn</id>
    <updated>2013-02-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <published>2013-02-11T00:00:00+00:00</published>
    <link href="http://sivers.org/xn"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;
When you hear, “It's all who you know,” it sounds so intimidating - like you need to be a former roommate of Mark Zuckerburg, cousins with Richard Branson, and dating Taylor Swift.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
But simply contacting a stranger can lead to a worldwide network of connections.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
When I was 18, at &lt;a href="http://berklee.edu/"&gt;Berklee College of Music&lt;/a&gt;, we had a guest speaker named &lt;a href="http://www.spiritmusicgroup.com/about/team/mark-fried"&gt;Mark Fried&lt;/a&gt;, who was an executive at &lt;a href="http://www.bmi.com/"&gt;BMI&lt;/a&gt; - a big music company in New York City.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
He walked into the classroom just before class began, and I heard him ask the teacher, “Oh, I thought we were going to have food.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The teacher said, “Oh, no, sorry, I thought you ate already! Didn't you have lunch?”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Mark said, “Damn. No. And it's a two hour class. Oh well.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Hearing this, I quickly ran out of the room and called &lt;a href="http://www.supremepizzapasta.com/"&gt;Supreme's Pizza&lt;/a&gt;, asking them to deliver three large pizzas to classroom #115.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
45 minutes later, the pizzas showed up. I gave one to Mark and shared two with the class.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
He smiled at me and said, “Good move. I owe you one. Here's my card. Call me any time, and let me know how I can help. When you come to New York City, I'll be happy to meet up.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
For the next two years, I took him up on that, sending him my new songs for feedback, and he'd tell me his insights and advice about the music industry.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
When I told Mark I wanted to move to New York, he said, “Send me your resume, and I'll find you a job.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Sure enough, a few weeks later, I got a call in my dorm room from Julie Gengo at &lt;a href="http://www.warnerchappell.com/"&gt;Warner/Chappell Music Publishing&lt;/a&gt;, saying, “We need someone to run our tape room, and Mark Fried said we should hire you.  Can you start Monday?”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Just like that, I was in.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Because I was working inside Warner Brothers, it was easy to meet everybody in the New York City music scene.  Every person I met connected me to many more.  A few years later, it was no problem to move to Los Angeles, because I now had a huge network in LA, through one degree of separation.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Now it's grown worldwide.  Whether I'm visiting Iceland, Shanghai, Rio, Japan, or Silicon Valley, I've got a wonderful network of connections to call on, and people worldwide who can call on me anytime.  Usually we know eachother loosely - having only traded a couple emails - but those quickly turn into real friendships.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
All because I bought a pizza for a stranger.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Surrounded by success&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Soon after arriving in New York, I was surrounded by successful people.  I was only 20 years old, but &lt;strong&gt;I learned so much from watching how people become successful, hearing their stories, philosophies, and mistakes.&lt;/strong&gt;  Opportunities were everywhere.  (A chance recommendation from my roommate got me a gig touring the world, &lt;a href="http://sivers.org/sakamoto"&gt;playing guitar for Ryuichi Sakamoto&lt;/a&gt;.)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
These people shaped the way I see the world.  &lt;strong&gt;The people you surround yourself with don't just open doors. They change the way you think, and change your self-image of your capabilities!&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
When you're surrounded by successful people, it feels so easy, it's obvious.  Their attitude and actions rub off on you.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
But I meet so many people that feel that success is so far away, so impossible to imagine, that they act accordingly, aim low, and complete the self-defeating circle.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I know much of success is luck, but I never realized how much the mindset of success comes from who you know.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Luckily, who you know is &lt;a href="http://sivers.org/people-per-week"&gt;up to you&lt;/a&gt;, not luck.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;No need to be in the big city&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I used to advise ambitious people to move to the big city, where everything is happening.  And it's still true that it offers some benefits.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
But more and more it feels like &lt;strong&gt;“where everything is happening” is &lt;em&gt;online&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - and &lt;strong&gt;the way to &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt; there is to &lt;em&gt;create&lt;/em&gt; something that adds to it.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Most of the fascinating and successful people I know now are people I met online.  I see something they've done, or they see something I've done, one of us sends the other an email, and that's it.  A few emails, maybe a phone call, and we're friends.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
What's even more fascinating is finding out that the super-connectors, the people who know everybody and everybody knows, are often physically remote.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
For example, some of the most connected people I know now are:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://karol.gajda.com/about/"&gt;Karol Gajda&lt;/a&gt; in Poland&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.tropicalmba.com/about-the-tropical-mba/"&gt;Dan Andrews&lt;/a&gt; in Bali&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://unicornfree.com/"&gt;Amy Hoy&lt;/a&gt; who just moved from Vienna to Philadelphia&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.kalzumeus.com/"&gt;Patrick McKenzie&lt;/a&gt; in Japan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://sebastianmarshall.com/about"&gt;Sebastian Marshall&lt;/a&gt; who bounces between Mongolia, China, and Taiwan.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The reasons they're so connected are:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;because they keep creating great stuff and posting it online&lt;/strong&gt;, which gets the attention of their peers, so soon “everyone” knows who they are&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;because they reach out to say hello to the people they admire&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So if it seems that there's an uncrossable canyon between you and your heroes, don't forget that all it takes is one connection to catch your rope, so you can shimmy across.  And you can do this from anywhere by creating great stuff online, and reaching out to potential friends.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
No need to attend Harvard with Mark Zuckerburg.  No need to become a cousin of Richard Branson.  And no need to date Taylor Swift.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;(See.  There are three things you can cross off your TO-DO list now.)&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
