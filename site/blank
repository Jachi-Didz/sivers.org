At the last apartment I rented, everything was white on white when I arrived.  White walls, counters, table, furniture, and carpet.
</p>
<p>
So I took it one step further, bought five blank canvases, and hung them around the apartment.
Especially one big one, right at the entrance.
</p>
<p>
Visitors would get upset, saying, “You've got to put something there!  You can't just leave it blank!  It needs color!”
</p>
<p>
I'd say, “Good point.  Like what.  What do you imagine?”
</p>
<p>
They'd say, “Y'know, like some bold splashes of dark red, but not too heavy.  Something with clean lines.”

</p>
<p>
They'd stare at the blank canvas a bit, and go into more detail about what should be on it.
</p>
<p>
Eventually I'd say, “Nah.  Not going to do it.”

</p>
<p>
Same thing with that business idea you've had forever.
</p>
<p>
Or that beautiful person you haven't spoken with.
</p>
<p>
So maybe you should just leave them in your imagination, where they're at their best.
</p>
<p>
