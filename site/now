<h1>What I’m doing now</h1>
<p>
<strong>I’m retired (<a href="/hate">today</a>).</strong>  I only do things for intrinsic reasons - not money.
</p><p>
I stay quite focused each day, avoiding distractions.  <strong>I spend all my time on these things:</strong> <em>(in order of time spent)</em>
</p><ul>
<li>being a full-time dad half the week</li>
<li>programming the web apps listed <a href="/projects">here</a></li>
<li>writing <a href="/blog">essays</a> and a new book</li>
<li>answering emails that ask my advice</li>
<li>deepening friendships &amp; finding new ones</li>
<li>reading <a href="/book">books</a> to better think, work, or live</li>
<li>weightlifting, running, cycling, hiking</li>
<li><a href="/book/FluentForever">learning</a> French</li>
</ul>
</p><p>
Those are my priorities.  <strong>I don’t want to do anything else right now.</strong>
</p><p>
People often ask me to do other things.  The most common requests are:
</p><ul>
<li>promoting their business or project</li>
<li>investing in their business</li>
<li>mentoring their business</li>
<li>speaking at their conference</li>
<li>doing an interview with their site/podcast</li>
</ul><p>
I sincerely wish them the best, and often wish I could help more, but <strong>I say no to all requests</strong>, because my next few years are already full. (I’m guessing that’s how long it will take to finish what I’ve started.)
</p><p>
From 2009-2012, I spent most of my time saying yes to requests.  Years went by and I got almost no work done, because I was so busy helping others.  A big reason <a href="/here">I moved to New Zealand</a> was to be far away from distractions, and focused on my work.
</p><p>
<strong>My main act of public service is answering my emails</strong>, so feel free to <a href="mailto:derek@sivers.org">email</a>, but I can’t spend more than a few minutes on each one.  When I get a question like, “Look at my business and tell me what I should do,” I just have to say I don’t know, since it would take me hours or days to get into it properly.  But I can answer almost anything else.
</p><p>
Sometimes, when I finish a big project and I'm ready to take a break, I'll do interviews.
(<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdq2aAqrQ4c">Fun example, here</a>.)
</p><p>
I only say yes to a conference if it’s filled with the kinds of people I seek out as dear friends - (not business friends). Basically, I consider it a party, not a conference.  I’m just there for the people.
</p><p>
<strong>If anything here changes, I'll update this page.</strong>  Last update was October 2014.
